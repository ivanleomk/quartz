<li>Speaker 0: is a study that was published in the journal cell metabolism. A cell press journal. Excellent journal. And the title of the paper is fasting blood glucose as a predictor
Speaker 1: of mortality lost in translation. And I&rsquo;ll explain what the lost in translation part means in a moment.
Speaker 0: But the basic takeaway of this study and I should mention
Speaker 1: that the first author of the study is Polly Yeah guru.
Speaker 0: P A L L Y Y A Gur you guru,
Speaker 1: polly Polly Yeah guru
Speaker 0: at all. The basic finding of the study is that in humans, higher blood glucose is associated
Speaker 1: with mortality.
Speaker 0: And in fact, if you look at blood glucose, resting blood glucose across (

<ul>
<li>Note: Higher glucose is correlated with mortality. resting blood glucose increases over time as we age</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speaker 1: different aspects of health.
Speaker 0: This is a large scale study. It
Speaker 1: was published in Jama, the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the
Speaker 0: very top
Speaker 1: tier journals in the
Speaker 0: area of medicine. And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up
Speaker 1: there meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard.
Speaker 0: This paper where chris is the first author, it&rsquo;s Gardner at
Speaker 1: All, Jama looked at weight loss in people following one particular diet versus another particular diet
Speaker 0: And this was a 12 month weight loss study. So it was focused specifically on weight loss,
Speaker 1: although they looked at some other parameters as well.
Speaker 0: And the basic conclusion of the study was that there was no significant (

<ul>
<li>Note: No significant difference between diets for weight loss - what only matters is that of caloric deficit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speaker 1: I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism
Speaker 0: and
Speaker 1: hormones and other factors that impact appetite,
Speaker 0: We don&rsquo;t have time to go into
Speaker 1: all those details now. Although you&rsquo;re welcome to listen to that
Speaker 0: episode as well. But we can briefly describe the overall conditions
Speaker 1: that are set in the body when we eat and when we don&rsquo;t eat.
Speaker 0: The key word here is
Speaker 1: conditions. If I can emphasize anything today, it&rsquo;s that what you eat
Speaker 0: and when you eat
Speaker 1: it set conditions in your body
Speaker 0: and those conditions can be very good for you or very
Speaker 1: bad for you depending on when you eat.
Speaker 0: In fact when you eat is as important as what you (

<ul>
<li>Note: When you eat is as important to why you eat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speaker 0: So insulin and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down. Even if we stop
Speaker 1: eating, they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down. It takes time.
Speaker 0: This is very important because if you look at the scientific literature
Speaker 1: on fasting
Speaker 0: on time restricted feeding, it&rsquo;s absolutely clear
Speaker 1: that the health benefits not just the weight loss benefits, but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding
Speaker 0: occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time and that gives us an anchor for from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions
Speaker 1: in the body over (

</li>
<li>Speaker 0: of one&rsquo;s day. So for humans that&rsquo;s typically in the
Speaker 1: early part of the day
Speaker 0: or the later
Speaker 1: part of the day, but not at night.
Speaker 0: Put very simply. There are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24 hour cycle is very
Speaker 1: detrimental to one&rsquo;s health. In fact,
Speaker 0: when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health when we see light, can enhance our feelings of well being or can diminish
Speaker 1: our feelings of wellbeing.
Speaker 0: I&rsquo;ve talked many times before about this on
Speaker 1: the Huberman lab podcast that
Speaker 0: during the daytime you want to get as much sunlight and other types of
Speaker 1: bright light in your eyes as is safely possible. And
Speaker 0: then you want to avoid light in the middle of the (

<ul>
<li>Note: Get as much light as possible in the morning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speaker 0: when you eat is as important as what you eat In this study, they saw something really interesting which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit.
Speaker 1: things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,
Speaker 0: but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular, stable so called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm. You may be surprised to learn that 80% 80% of the genes in your
Speaker 1: body and brain
Speaker 0: are on a 24 hour schedule. That is, they change their
