## Highlights
- Speaker 0: in this market cycle is that it creates efficiencies that are relevant for smart contracting, both at the base layer and at higher layers in payment channels, for instance, like lightning network. So that's exciting. Taproot is will activate in november and not only will it have an impact on privacy scalability of the core protocol, but it will also impact, like I said, opportunities in smart contracting and it will allow us it'll sort of set the stage for future upgrades like any prev out which has relevancy for other sorts of increased functionality at the lightning network level. And that's quite important because when we're thinking about ([Time 0:06:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478662))
    - Note: Taproot is coming to Bitcoin
- Speaker 0: data center, software, cybersecurity, foundational sort of technologies and Bitcoin. I found Bitcoin in that sort of mind space. And so I saw Bitcoin first as a protocol as a technology that would be a platform for the proliferation of a new sort of app ecosystem. And you know, in that way I approach it really as a sound tech maximum, not as a Bitcoin maximalist per se. I also spent time in 2013 2014 looking at all coins. I I think that I was the second or third maybe VC two due diligence in the I C. O space even ([Time 0:09:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478667))
    - Note: Her stance on bi coin
- Speaker 0: Okay, so a couple things you said a couple of things there, I'll try to hit all of them. So you talked a little bit about the attention shifting to defy this space where 100,000 traders have permission list access to trade sort of the long tail of assets that they might not otherwise have access to and they can do that without having to go through a K Y C process. And you know, it's also interesting to see folks making money in a quick way and it attracts media attention now. On the Bitcoin side. What's been happening is that Bitcoin has been declared a legal tender in El Salvador, we've seen the folks in El Salvador used Bitcoin on a day to day basis by using the Lightning ([Time 0:16:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b6001147866d))
    - Note: Big question about Bitcoin maximimalism
- Speaker 0: see folks like thinks that taking advantage of that now to talk about some of the development in the side chain space, we maybe, I'll start with stacks, which is a side channel air one side chain, they define it as in the Bitcoin space that has fully functional smart contracts live as of january of this year. We're seeing contracts of up to a billion dollars in aggregate commitments be present in that environment. Recently it was announced that there is an accelerator built to fund companies that are that are building in the stacks ecosystem. You know, I think that my expectation is that we will see projects like a, you know, swap like ([Time 0:23:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba662))
    - Note: Interesting developments in Bitcoin including Sphinx
- Speaker 0: or in lieu of it being present on Bitcoin and liquid does that. So as an example, liquid has smart contracting capability through something called covenants, which just means that you can essentially programmed Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is programmable money, It is that at the base layer, that's, you know, one of the areas of popular fud that I've seen from this bull market is, you know, saying that Bitcoin doesn't allow for smart contracts. And of course, that's not true. Bitcoin. Smart contracting has always existed at the core protocol level, but the sort of smart contracts that you can do on liquid as well as of the side chains take it a step further in. Bitcoin has that with covenants ([Time 0:24:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478675))
    - Note: Side chains in Bitcoin
- Speaker 1: something resembling UNICEF or care about having N. F. T. S on the side change versus how much is it? Is it just to prove that it can theoretically be done 
  Speaker 0: well? Bitcoin owners are not a monolith, right? And so it doesn't, I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure frankly that I care what Bitcoin or that we should care about what Bitcoin Ear's which I imagine you're mostly referring to folks that are active on social media. I'm not sure that it matters what folks want. The importance of Bitcoin owners to Bitcoin is that they are, it's a stakeholder group in a multi stakeholder ecosystem. So you have folks that use the tech and that's ([Time 0:27:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba65d))
    - Note: Do Bitcoinera even care about side chains
- Speaker 1: So I want to actually ask you a uh about a controversy in the question of Bitcoin development and there is a view that you're on the board of blog stream. There's all these criticisms, even among Bitcoin is a blog stream that it exerts an extraordinary amount of influence on Bitcoin core development that there are all there are other ideas such as drive chains, which is a different idea for scaling ([Time 0:35:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6d2f0a4042f000f4d8603))
    - Note: Hard Forks ba Soft forks
