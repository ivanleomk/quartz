## Highlights
- Speaker 0: topic, you have a long list of things that you're clueless about and being aware of of what your ignorance is leaves you to doubt your convictions. It makes you curious about what you don't know and that opens your mind and new discoveries. And then every time you learn something new, it's not the sign that oh, now I'm an expert, it's this sense that well, there's so much more to learn, right? And I've I've made a tiny tiny dot of progress in, you know, a whole universe of knowledge and I can't wait to see what I learned next. And so I think one of the things we need to do is we need to give ourselves permission to enter rethinking cycles. And there are a lot of ways to do that we could we could talk about. But Shane, I'm going to ask you about this because a couple a ([Time 0:10:36](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea31a4f0c000e83ac07))

    - Note: Rethinking cycles
- Speaker 1: There's a lot of uncertainty in what we're doing. I'm open to rethinking it, but I also I need to take action and I need to do something and then you have an escalation of commitment, the more action you take, which it becomes harder and harder to rethink the sunk costs building up. You have other sort of escalations. How do you balance those two things between being open and also affording yourself the choices that you need to make to exist in an organization and seize opportunity? 
  Speaker 0: I don't know that there's a way to get the best of both worlds in every situation. I do think though, that you can create conditions that at least increase the probability that you end up both open and decisive at the same time, which is a sort of strange combination. So for ([Time 0:13:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2ed))
    - Note: Goal is to be open and decisive - setting co dictions yo rethink
- Speaker 0: ultimately will require a bigger investment of time. It probably requires more people involved too. Uh That time has an opportunity cost. And so maybe we feel like we're giving something up, I don't know about you. If I'm going to hire someone and commit to working with them, I cannot invest enough time up front to decide that that's a good choice. It's interesting to 
  Speaker 1: me to listen to you say that because what comes to mind is like, there are organizations that invest incredible amounts of energy, time money into this, their sports organization, all sports before they draft somebody. It's like, what is the person's character? How well do they recognize the place? How well do they, is it intuition versus professionalism on their part? Right. And they have these ways of evaluating ([Time 0:19:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2d8))
    - Note: Example of interview process which is more algorithmic
- Speaker 0: your ways of fixing those flaws. And I think ironically knowing that people might be a little bit on guard or a little bit suspicious actually lead leaders to be more authentic and to come in and say, you know what the whole reason that I'm going to talk about areas for growth is. I want to get better. And so the more honest I can be about that, the more likely I am to grow. And so I think it's the responsibility of people in power to open that door and keep it open right and this this step to prove right here is the stuff people told me I am terrible at, here's how I've benefited from hearing those things in the past. That's one of the best ways that you can show that you really mean it. I think when 
  Speaker 1: I asked this question about psychological safety, I actually presume to know what some of those ([Time 0:27:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea31a4f0c000e83ac10))
    - Note: Leadership and psychological safety
- Speaker 0: mistakes I made, when I talk about embarrassing decisions I've made. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to signal to our kids that it's okay to be wrong and it's okay to rethink the choices we've made. Uh that's to me, one of the functions of regret, right? I I think of most negative emotions as teachable moments and the whole point of experiencing them is you're supposed to learn something from what you did wrong so you can make it right in the future. And so much of regret is saying, okay, I did something that uh that lead to an undesirable outcome or that violated one of my values. And so how do I do this differently? Moving forward Instead of trying to deny these emotions? Let's actually listen to them and figure out what the lesson is in them. 
  Speaker 1: You mentioned rewriting the history ([Time 0:52:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2f3))
    - Note: Parenting rewriting
- Speaker 0: not just experiments, Those are those are real commitments. And I think this is as relevant to personal decisions as it is to running a company right to say, okay, before I go into a major decision, if it is both irreversible and highly consequential, then I want to spend a lot of time rethinking my own views up front. Whereas if it's pretty easy to reverse an undue or it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go forward and make the decision knowing I'll have time later and the opportunity later to second guess it. 
  Speaker 1: But it's not enough to just sort of convince yourself you have the opportunity, you have to be of the mindset that that's sort of almost what you're looking to do. Did you learn anything else from Jeff and or amazon about how they make decisions? Because I think they're one of the best large organizations we've ([Time 0:58:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2fc))
