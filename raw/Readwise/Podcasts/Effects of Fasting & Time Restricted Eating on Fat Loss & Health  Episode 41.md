## Highlights
- Speaker 0: is a study that was published in the journal cell metabolism. A cell press journal. Excellent journal. And the title of the paper is fasting blood glucose as a predictor 
  Speaker 1: of mortality lost in translation. And I'll explain what the lost in translation part means in a moment. 
  Speaker 0: But the basic takeaway of this study and I should mention 
  Speaker 1: that the first author of the study is Polly Yeah guru. 
  Speaker 0: P A L L Y Y A Gur you guru, 
  Speaker 1: polly Polly Yeah guru 
  Speaker 0: at all. The basic finding of the study is that in humans, higher blood glucose is associated 
  Speaker 1: with mortality. 
  Speaker 0: And in fact, if you look at blood glucose, resting blood glucose across ([Time 0:03:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b34c))
    - Note: Higher glucose is correlated with mortality. resting blood glucose increases over time as we age
- Speaker 1: different aspects of health. 
  Speaker 0: This is a large scale study. It 
  Speaker 1: was published in Jama, the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the 
  Speaker 0: very top 
  Speaker 1: tier journals in the 
  Speaker 0: area of medicine. And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up 
  Speaker 1: there meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard. 
  Speaker 0: This paper where chris is the first author, it's Gardner at 
  Speaker 1: All, Jama looked at weight loss in people following one particular diet versus another particular diet 
  Speaker 0: And this was a 12 month weight loss study. So it was focused specifically on weight loss, 
  Speaker 1: although they looked at some other parameters as well. 
  Speaker 0: And the basic conclusion of the study was that there was no significant ([Time 0:14:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b378))
    - Note: No significant difference between diets for weight loss - what only matters is that of caloric deficit
- Speaker 1: I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism 
  Speaker 0: and 
  Speaker 1: hormones and other factors that impact appetite, 
  Speaker 0: We don't have time to go into 
  Speaker 1: all those details now. Although you're welcome to listen to that 
  Speaker 0: episode as well. But we can briefly describe the overall conditions 
  Speaker 1: that are set in the body when we eat and when we don't eat. 
  Speaker 0: The key word here is 
  Speaker 1: conditions. If I can emphasize anything today, it's that what you eat 
  Speaker 0: and when you eat 
  Speaker 1: it set conditions in your body 
  Speaker 0: and those conditions can be very good for you or very 
  Speaker 1: bad for you depending on when you eat. 
  Speaker 0: In fact when you eat is as important as what you ([Time 0:19:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b33a))
    - Note: When you eat is as important to why you eat
- Speaker 0: So insulin and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down. Even if we stop 
  Speaker 1: eating, they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down. It takes time. 
  Speaker 0: This is very important because if you look at the scientific literature 
  Speaker 1: on fasting 
  Speaker 0: on time restricted feeding, it's absolutely clear 
  Speaker 1: that the health benefits not just the weight loss benefits, but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding 
  Speaker 0: occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time and that gives us an anchor for from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions 
  Speaker 1: in the body over ([Time 0:23:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b317))
    - Note: The most important thing is to set the conditions that are best for brain or your body
- Speaker 0: of one's day. So for humans that's typically in the 
  Speaker 1: early part of the day 
  Speaker 0: or the later 
  Speaker 1: part of the day, but not at night. 
  Speaker 0: Put very simply. There are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24 hour cycle is very 
  Speaker 1: detrimental to one's health. In fact, 
  Speaker 0: when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health when we see light, can enhance our feelings of well being or can diminish 
  Speaker 1: our feelings of wellbeing. 
  Speaker 0: I've talked many times before about this on 
  Speaker 1: the Huberman lab podcast that 
  Speaker 0: during the daytime you want to get as much sunlight and other types of 
  Speaker 1: bright light in your eyes as is safely possible. And 
  Speaker 0: then you want to avoid light in the middle of the ([Time 0:31:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4116b6164086c09b388))
    - Note: Get as much light as possible in the morning
- Speaker 0: when you eat is as important as what you eat In this study, they saw something really interesting which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit. 
  Speaker 1: things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that I'll talk about in a moment, 
  Speaker 0: but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular, stable so called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm. You may be surprised to learn that 80% 80% of the genes in your 
  Speaker 1: body and brain 
  Speaker 0: are on a 24 hour schedule. That is, they change their 
  Speaker 1: Levels going from high to low ([Time 0:32:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4116b6164086c09b3b4))
    - Note: Fasting with an allows for the expression of epigenetic genes at the right time
