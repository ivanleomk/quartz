## Highlights
- These words fell upon Buddha’s ears. He had what we call Satori 2 in Zen, an instant realization; his first flash of awakening. He understood and said to himself, ‘I have been too hard on myself. While in my father’s palace I lived a life of luxury, an almost debauched life, and now I have gone to the other extreme of depriving my body and mind of even basic nutrition and care
- You are always tinkering your veena (lute),’ one of the bards chastised his companion who was fixing the strings of his lute.‘Either you make the strings so tight they snap or you make them so loose that they are out of tune. Only if you leave them the way they are supposed to be, will you be able to produce melodious music
- Living a graceful life that has meaning and happiness is an art anyone can master. Essentially, that is what Zen is about: a state free of conditioning so that the mind can rest and rejoice, so it may go with the flow of life without the anxiety to always get somewhere. Life is here. Now. Though it is easier said than done, it is possible
- This is awakening in a nutshell: to have a graceful response to everything life throws at you without losing your sense of serenity and inner calm.
- To be enlightened is to take things lightly (though not for granted), to laugh away the whims and irritabilities of life. We tend to take ourselves too seriously, making that the root cause of most of our agony
- Even though I have used the word ‘gained’, enlightenment is not something you gain or attain, it is something you become.
- You are sleeping and I am awake. You sleep through your whole lives, and I am aware of each passing moment.’
- It should be noted that the philosophy of Zen says that if you meet Buddha on the road, kill him, because Zen believes that you must not idolize anybody. For when you idolize someone, you hinder your growth. Having said that, the tradition of the guru-disciple relationship is as alive in Zen as in any Eastern school of thought.
- Maintaining awareness of the present moment requires doing one thing at a time so as to focus on your chief activity
- Zen is breaking the automaticity of our actions and infusing them with mindfulness. Everything we do then becomes meditation, leading to greater peace
- That is when your mind is perfectly, 100 per cent silent. Then you gain incredible insight into the nature of things, into the nature of your own life
- When you get a hand on mindfulness and begin to put it to use in your daily life, I promise you that you will change forever (for the better). You will see things in life you were unable to see earlier
- There is a very real and beautiful reason behind it. You see, a flower is a living thing. It has life and with time it withers.
- When your mind blooms, the whole world is in spring. When it experiences autumn, no matter how much beauty there is in the external world, all feels lacklustre.
- You are a flower and you have a beautiful life. Believe that. Compare your lifestyle to those of billions of people, who can’t even afford to live a basic life.
- Not everybody enjoys the luxuries of life, but you do
- Zen teaches us that happiness is not a pursuit. It’s not something we have to seek
- In the thousand years after Buddha passed away, Zen did not really catch on. This is because people need anchors; people, they need rituals. When I say to people, ‘Just sit and be aware; you don’t have to do anything,’ they think it isn’t sufficient
- For 1000 years, people did not pay much attention to the Zen system of meditation partly because different sects had sprung out of the Buddhist thought and they were busy proving their supremacy over each other and busy fighting amongst themselves
