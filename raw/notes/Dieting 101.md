# The Rough Overview

> Your body composotionm will be 100% of the result of your net energy balance. if your input is greater than your output you will gain weight. If your input is less than your output you will lose weight 


What you want to be looking and tracking is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). You can estimate your TDEE by first getting your Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ).

The formula is

> 10 * weight (in kg) + 6.25 * height (in cm) - 5 * age in years + 5

In my case, my weight is ~76.5 and my height is ~170 so at 25 years of age, I am approximately working with a BMR of ~1707.5. I work out quite actively so i'd then estimate my TDEE by taking my BMR and multiplying it between 1.8 to 2.2. This gives me a range of 3073.5 to 3756.5.

We'd then need to weigh ourselves over a period of a couple of weeks in order to see how accurate this actual estimate might be. 

# Macros

## Protein
Protein timing will come down to preference. Keep protein to around 1-1.25 grams / lbs which is approximately 0.5-0.65 grams / kg. 

## Carbs

Carbs are needed in order to derive the gyclogen to workouts. That's why when we go on a low-carb diet we rarely feel like we have a lot of energy.

## Fat
Fat is important, we specifically want monostaurated and polyunsaturated fats that come from fish, flaxseeds, walnuts and other sources of high omega 3 fatty acids. Avoid your trans fat.

# Goals and Macro Setup

## Muscle Gain
You want to eat around 3-500 calories over mantenance for an adequate surplus. Ideally you want to stick to the increase in calories for about 12 weeks at least so that you can. build an appreciable amount of muscle mass.

The ideal metrics here are around .25 - 0.5 kg of increase in weight. 

## Weight Loss
You want to eat about 3-500 calories less than your TDEE.  You should start slow. The largest weight loss will be at the start when you lose water weight and some muscle gyclogen. After a couple weeks, this will stall and you'll start to see what the actual rate of fat loss is. 

# Mindsets
## Cheat Meals
Cheat meals should be around once a week if you're below 15% body fat and around twice a month when you're above 15% body fat.

## Food Composition
Ideally, you'll want to have around 80% of your daily caloric needs with nutrient dense, satisating foods and 20% with things that would be considered "junk" food. You'll want to eat around 2.2-2.4 g of protein / kg of bodyweight.  That would be approximately 140g of protein for me.. ?

## Strength Loss
You can make Strength Gains while working on a caloric deficit.

# Interesting Alternatives

## Mini-Cuts
Just cut down to around 1200-1400 calories and stay there. Eugene Teo does this from time to time. Period of time for the cut should be a maximum of 6 weeks at most before going on maintanence for double that time after.
