# Introduction

Cardio is simply a way for you to work out your cardiovascular system. It's not super complex and we simply need to make sure we're doing a healthy amount of high intensitiy and low intensity work. 

The benefits are extensive and we can obtain benefits such as 
- Lower Blood pressure
- Increased Blood Flow
- Improved work capacity ( you can lift more weights )

## LISS

Low intensity Steady State cardio is a form of cardio where you mantain your heart rate at around 6-70% of the max heart rate. Generally involves relaxing activities such as swimming or walking.

> Recomended Ammount : 20 Minutes, 3-7 minutes per week where you try to raise your heart rate to around 60-70% of your maximum heart rate

Do not do more than 55 minutes of cardio per session and no more than two sessions a day 

## HIIT
HIIT involves the use of short, intense bursts of activity, followed by a recovery period of much less intense activitiy. The goal is to get the heart rate as high as possible by applying maximum effort before allowing the body to recover and the repeating.

This gets the body to use the anaerobic pathway to perform the exercise and in turn increases your VO2 max.

> Recomended Amount : 15 minutes and around 2-4 times a week
