# Introduction

> The average web developer creates websites. Professionals create effective websites that are focused on results


You are, and should be someone who helps businesses improve their sales online. You want to create effective websites that achieve the business goals as well as the website visitor goals. 

Here are some things you can do
- Research the competitors of the business to see what they are doing well online
- Thinking about the goals for the website visitor

Professionals view websites as an effective marketing tool because that's how they are able to drive more results. Anyone can create wordpress websites or code websites, but you want to build websites that get results. 

The only way to do this is to improve your skillset by learning these things, strategizing better and then applying everything.

## Action Plan

1. Determine who your ideal client is (Eg. Local Coffee Shops, Small Local Businesses)
2. Start writing blog articles
3. Use testimonials in order to convince clients
4. Decide on pricing structure

Things that you want to offer
- SEO Optimization 
	- Google Map Submission
	- Social Media Management ( Use Facebook and Instagram )
- Articles
	- Spend < 1hr writing each article and copy text into a HTML converter + add some images
	- Some article ideas include
		- The 10 best (niche) in (insert area)
		- How to choose the right (coffee)
		- 5 Health Benefits of Coffee

5. Getting clients
	- Use google Adwords - target the following ads
		- Coffee Shop website tmeplate
		- Coffee shop website theme
		- Web designer for small business
		- Web designer for coffee shop
		- Website design for coffee shop
	- Facebook groups
		- Join groups such as Coffee Shop Owners in "XYZ " city
		- Then post articles on how coffee shops can grow their business, psychology tips, productivity tips etc
		- Then afterwards, mesage each member directly or post occassionally to the group on how you can help grow business
		- Takes about ~3 months to get your first client
	- Manual Work
		- Manually search for coffee shops
			- You want to find coffee shops that (1) do not have a website and (2) do not show up on google for their coffee shop

> You are helping their business grow and they are just paying you to do so. It's an exchange of value for value

- Alternatively
	- Search for companies and only choose those that are already running ads
		- Send them a tailored report of what is wrong with their website and work from there to help them
		- Offer to build them a website
	- Create a niche website
		- Eg. Swimming Pool Pump searches -> swimmingpoolpumps.com
		- Sell the domain to a swimming pool pump company and then rank it on google and then "rent" the domain to them with their contact info
		- It helps businesses look more niche
		- Sample domains
			- [word]installers.com
			- [word]installation.com
			- [word]price.com
			- [word]quotes.com
			- [word]contracters.com
		- You now just need the site to rank. This will require you to simply create the site around the main search term, get it ranked on google and then approach businesses
	- Create a directory website
		- Find a good niche
		- Create a good site
		- Rank the site on google
		- Get monthly/annual payments for each listing
