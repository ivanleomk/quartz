# Coding Career Stages

## Junior Developer

### Professional Job Checklist
- [ ] Try to pair program with your mentors and peers. This helps them to discover where you make mistakes and give more context than normally avaliable in a code review
- [ ] When asking for help, present good documentation of your error ( see : [[Documenting An Error]])
- [ ] Say yes to increased basic responsibilities! Proactively ask managers and product owners if there are things that you can take off their plate. ( Your job is to support them : When you look good, they look good )
- [ ] Actively seek out cross functional exposure to understand how other developers in the company work and put yourself in the path of key projects that will have major impact at your company


> Make sure to do a good job with the work that you have committed to. Your personal brand is the work you produce each week


Most of the time, it is quite often doing the things that nobody else wants to do that makes you indispensible. A great way to do so is to volunteer to write tests

### Personal Endeavours
> You don't stop learning just because you landed your first job


- [ ] Read more technical books. Consider looking at [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) and [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [ ] Learning more frameworks and languages
- [ ] Building useful side projects
- [ ] Guest write for industrial sites and start blogging to learn in public

## Senior Developer

### Breaking Into The Role

> What matters the most are two things - what your company looks for in a Senior Developer and whether they are willing to pay you commensurate with the market rate for Senior Developer

This largely depends on two main things

1. Getting enough prerequisite skills and accomplishments specified by the Company
2. Successfully marketing yourself as meeting enough of those requirements to be hired into that role

This can be broken down into a few universal qualities

1. Solid Technical Expertise
2. Impact on your team's work
3. Being able to work across Teams
4. Seeing the bigger picture
5. Mentoring others

> Your goal is to be able to acquire as much Tacit knowledge as possible. This is knowledge which is new and uniquely earned through your own experiences and network

You'll want to spend a lot of time looking for particular metrics you can cite
- Cost savings per year
- Monthly Active User increases
- Time To Interactive drops

among other useful metrics...

### Excelling at the Role

# Strategy
> You bear ultimate responsibility for your career. Never them.

There are four main aspects of strategy

1. Reality : Where you currently are
2. Vision : Where you want to go
3. Plans : Your idea on how to get there
4. Policy : Your methodology to use on what to make decisions along the way


> Working on the right problem dominates speed.
