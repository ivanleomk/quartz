# The Foundation

> A piece of content qualifies as a note if it has been interpreted through your lens. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value into itself.

We utilise the CODE method in order to accurately capture fledging thoughts

1. C : Capture what resonates
2. O : Organize information based on its existing utility to you
3. D : Distill and find what matters
4. E : Express your creativity

## Capture

Value is not evenly distributed when it comes to content. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful or valuable to you. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.

The important thing here is to make it simple and easy for you to capture these bits of information. 

**Find things that Inspire you** : Keep things which can help you to shift your perspective or maintain an attitude of gratitude

**Find things that are useful** ; If you think a piece of information might come in handy in the future, keep it in a folder

## Organize
