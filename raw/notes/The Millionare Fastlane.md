> This is a book which depicts some strategies on how to make good money and in the proccess begin to work towards financial freedom


# Get Rich Old

The traditional advice is to go to school, get good grades and then sometime when you are 65 years old, you will be rich. In short, sacrifice your today, your dreams and your life for a plan that pays dividends after most of your life has evaporated.

Get rich slow takes a lifetime to travel and its success is nefariously dependent on too many factors you cannot control. 

> The real golden years of life are when you're young, sentient and vibrant


# Mindsets
> Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event.

The millionare fastlane is a dark, deserted, unpaved road strewn with potholes that force change and evolution. If the road trip to wealth were easy, wouldn't everybody be wealthy?

> Your current financial situation is a product of your existing roadmap, whether chosen or not. 

There are three main roadmaps 
- Sidewalk - Poverty
- Slowlane - Mediocrity
- Fastlane - Wealth

## Sidewalkers

Most people are lifelong sidewalkers - a contract for a pleasurable today in lieu of a more secure tomorrow. Sidewalkers are carelessly trapped in a "Lifestyle Servitude" fed by an urgent, insatiable need for pleasure, image and instant gratitifcation.

> 61% of all individuals who earned income earned less than $35,000 a year. A life on the Sidewalk naturally pulls you to poverty.

A sidewalker has a wealth equation of

$$
Wealth = Income + Debt
$$
Sidewalkers create their lifestyle in direct proportion to their income and supplement that lifestyle with extensive use of debt. They make large incomes, with e very dime spent on the next lavish accoutrement.

Therefore, you need to have good financial planing.

### Sidewalkers and Luck
> The Sidewalkers manifesto is predicated on hithiking. When things don't work out as intended, blame unto others.

Sidewalkers want the easy life and want someone else to pay for it. They are victims of life because life dealt them a bad hand and vote for populist policies. **Immunization for victimitis occurs when you are both responsible for AND accountable to your actions and the possible poor consequences of those actions.  Own your mistakes, failuires and triumphs**


## Slowlane
The slowlane is a sacrifice of today in the hopes of a brighter and freer tomorrow.  You're constantly deluged with a series of doctrines that plead discipline to the trade-off.  Future crutches often justify pleasurable nows and behind the scenes, Lifestyle Servitude swells.

> The slowlane is a lifetime wager that a sacrificial today will yield a wealthier tomorrow

The driving force behind wealth under GetRichSlow is time - time employed at the job and time invested in the markets. 

$$
Wealth = Job + Market \space{} Investments
$$
Ultimately, life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning. 

> People glorify friday evenings because they celebrate the dividends of their trade - five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of unadulterated freedom.

> The slowlane is rooted in Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL)

You put your faith into a plan which has variables which cannot be controlled nor leveraged. This is important because to attract large sums of money, you need two things - Control and Leverage.

### A Job
Money is earned in a job via intrinsic value. This is determined by the marketplace and is the price at which you can trade your time for money. This is what you earn working a job. 

> Because intrinsic value is measured in terms of time, and we have a limited 24 hours of time, we cannot leverage a job to make good money

Because your time is limited to a small number and cannot be leveraged, the mathematics of a job are wealth punitive. **Small numbers do not make millionares**. 

### Investments

Compound Interest relies heavily on time, good amounts of yearly investment yield and an invested sum which is repeatedly invested. In other words

$$
\text{Compound Interest = Invested Sum}\times(1 + \text{yield})^{\text{time}}
$$
Neither time nor yield can be leveraged or controlled, as a result, this is a surefoot step to disaster.

### Education
The slowlane sometimes deploys education as a way in order to increase their intrinsic value (Eg. getting an MBA) to increase their rate. However, they're still trading their time for money and this doesn't allow you to increase the amount of \$\$ you're earning





## Wealth

> Wealth must be defined by the three trinity of things - Fitness, Family and Freedom. Luxury is but one small aspect of that


There are many individuals who look wealthy with the use of easy credit and long-term monthly financing options. But this comes at a huge cost, unaffordable material possessions have consequences to our health and relationships.

Looking wealthy is an enemy to real wealth - it destroys freedom, it destroys health and it destroys relationships. When we engage in more extravagant spending, we spend up reducing the amount of freedom that we have and detract away from real wealth.

If you're held hostage to your lifestyle, you aren't wealthy because you lack freedom.

> Money doesn't buy happiness when its misused. Instead, it buys bondage. Used properly, money buys freedom and in turn, choices.

Wealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy , energy and even some hair. 

## Affordability
Affordability is when you don't have to think about it. If you have to think about affordability, you can't afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences.

Don't buy things that you cannot afford. When that happens, instead of you owning your stuff, your stuff owns you. 

> Defend yourself by exposing the hook beneath the bait, the bucket of bondage which is lifestyle servitude.

## Jobs
Jobs suck because they limit because they're rooted in limited leverage and limited control, which mean they're severely limited in the scope of wealth.

- To trade time is to trade life : You sell your freedom to consume time
- Jobs limit the experience and skillsets that you're able to learn
- With a job, you're forced to play along to someone else's fiddle
- As an employee, your value is dictated and the job becomes a wealth delimiter with limits that cannot be subverted

Therefore, in a job we are selling our freedom ( in the form of time ) for money which gives us freedom. If we cannot control our primary income source, wealth accumulation becomes thwarted.
