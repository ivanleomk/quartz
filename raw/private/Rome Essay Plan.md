		- 38% of avaliable water was set aside for this purpose
		- This was a right which could only be granted by the emperor to his subjects. We see evidence of this today through the use of inscriptions on lead pipies ( fistulae) which number around 800 in Rome.
		- Most of this water was used as a means to power private baths and other decorative pieces which relied on water.
		-  Many of the individuals who were able to get access to these private sources belonged to powerful families.

		- Many of these commoners want to enjoy thje same benefits that these aristocrats enjoy which they cannot given their small aprtments.

# The Emperor Builds for his People

- In Rome, by contrast, the emperors acted themselves as patrons and benefactors. In Rome, they did not tolerate competition.The grandiose structures built for the people of Rome consumed by far the largest sums of money
- The emperor provided these luxury goods and hence public life - from politics and the administration of justice to shopping centers - an object of diversion and pleasure for the urban population. 
	- The roman citizenry was also offered a share in the things that had been reserved for the rich and their villas. 
	- The treasures and sumptuous building materials borught to Rome from all regions of the empire demonstrated that Rome, through the deeds of the emepror had become the center of the world.
- Imperial Baths

	- Through these communal bathing tasks, bathers experienced "community" in a community form.

			- 
		- At the same time, he was a supreme ruler destined for inclusion in the ranks of the pantheon of state gods
	- Unlike kings who predicated their authority on notions of rule by divine right, the Roman emperor had to justify his rule through achievement.
		- As a result, the people of Rome had to recognize these achievements with corresponding honors and ultimately with an apotheosis and its attendant rituals.
		- Such ruler-ideologies prevented the emperors from appearing to be kings and living in rotyal fashion
		- Therefore, he demonstrated his powers in building for the people
		- Emperors were evaluated based on how much they had built for their people and this resulted in emperors such as Tiberius who built little and were tight-fisted when it came to the games being evaluated harshly by historians
	- This meant that the eperor therefore became a type of patron of the Roman plebs. He had to tend to the Romans as a good patronus to his familia. In return the people had to stand behind the emperor in the manner of an extensive clientele
		- The emperor was operating in his patronage of costly buildings and games no differently than he did in distributions of money and grain
