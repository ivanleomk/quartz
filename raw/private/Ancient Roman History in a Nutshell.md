title: "Ancient Roman History in a Nutshell"
---

- Ancient Rome and power are linked
	- Rome's empire lasted longer than any other and was rivalled only by the Persian Achaemenids and the chinese Han dinesty
	- A system of law is an abstraction and that abstraction as well as people and groups of people exercise power
- Rome against Outsiders ( 400 BC to AD16 )
	- This begins from the emperor Tiberius to AD16 


Infrastructure today
- Thinking about utilities and running water in Rome
- Percieved as something that is competently handled and also political
	- Emperor gives the aqueducts to his people (Eg. Agrippa making big )
	- Political connections determine the access to water (private supplies at least)
	- Utilities that are not normal as we think of today but highly politicised but are baked into the system of patrilineage
