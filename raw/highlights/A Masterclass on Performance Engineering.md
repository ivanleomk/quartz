* Productivity is often described as your output over time; more output, less time means higher productivity.
* You need to clearly define your goals or you’ll waste your time.
* You need to have some kind of inspiration to wake you up in the morning to endure life’s daily struggles. If you think that your actions have no meaning, you will procrastinate and waste time.
* But, if you sit around thinking about how difficult it is, how to start, or all of the things you don’t know, you will never learn how to progress.
* imperfect action is infinitely better than perfect inaction.

* Sleeping between 10PM and 8AM
