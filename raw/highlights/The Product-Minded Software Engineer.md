## Highlights
* Product-minded engineers don’t settle for getting a specification and jumping to implement it. They think about other ideas and approach the product manager with these.
* Product-minded engineers don’t settle for getting a specification and jumping to implement it. They think about other ideas and approach the product manager with these.
* They take the time to understand how the business works, how the product fits in, and what its goals are.
* They often dive straight to data about business and user metrics, getting their hands on this data however they can.
* Product-minded engineers like talking with people outside engineering, learning about what and why they do.
* I frequently see them grabbing coffee, lunch, or doing a hallway chat with non-engineers.
* Because they do it all in their head, using their engineering and product insights, they get to valuable conclusions remarkably quickly.
* When a feature performs worse than expected, they are curious to understand where the mismatch was.
* Understand how and why your company is successful. What is the business model? How is money made? What parts are most profitable, what parts of the company are expanding the most? Why? How does your team fit into all of this?

* Most product managers jump at the opportunity to mentor engineers.
* Having engineers be interested in product means they can scale themselves more.
* Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table. After you have a good understanding of the business, the product and stakeholders: take initiative.
* Or you could suggest a larger effort, outlining the engineering effort and the product effort, making this easy to prioritize in the backlog.
* Think of not only making engineering tradeoffs for the product feature your team is building but suggest product tradeoffs that result in less engineering effort.
