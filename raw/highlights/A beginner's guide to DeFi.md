## Highlights
* Decentralized finance, also referred to as “DeFi” or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen.
* a stablecoin is engineered to remain “stable” at exactly 1.00 units of fiat. Most stablecoins are pegged to the USD, but some are in other fiat currencies like the Chinese RMB.
* For example, Maker is a system built on Ethereum that governs a decentralized stablecoin called DAI. DAI aims to be pegged at 1.00 USD. The way the peg works is that DAI can be “minted” by anyone within the Maker system by locking up crypto as collateral (primarily ETH) and taking out a loan of DAI. The collateral provided needs to be greater than the amount borrowed so that the loan is overcollateralized.
* Given functional stablecoins like USDC and DAI, we can start rebuilding pieces of the traditional financial system as automated smart contracts.
* they allow users to directly lend or borrow from the smart contract itself, which dynamically raises or lowers interest rates to match.
* The answer is that it’s a massively scalable application.
* The main risks are related to smart contract bugs and crypto volatility, but the interest rates are also substantially higher than typical bank rates of 2% or lower.
* Decentralized exchanges aim to address this by using smart contracts to reduce or eliminate middleman.The dream is fully peer-to-peer exchange of all digital assets.
* Buyers and sellers pull liquidity from the smart contract directly and receive a price quote based on the token quantity desired and the liquidity available.
* One issue with the decentralized lending and borrowing services mentioned thus far is that they require quite a lot of collateral.
* One of the first applications would be building blockchain analogs of fiat-based credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that institutions like banks rely on for credit scores.
