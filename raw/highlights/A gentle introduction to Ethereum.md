## Highlights
* What Bitcoin does for distributed data storage, Ethereum does for distributed data storage plus computations.
* Your computer becomes a ‘node’ on the network, running an Ethereum Virtual Machine, and behaves equivalently to all the other nodes. Remember in a peer-to-peer network there is no ‘master’ server and any computer has equivalent powers or status to any other.
* Like Bitcoin, mining participants create valid blocks by spending electricity to find solutions to a mathematical puzzle.
* Token ownership is tracked on the Ethereum blockchain, just like BTC ownership is tracked on Bitcoin’s blockchain, though at a technical level they track them in slightly different ways.
* In many descriptions, Ethereum smart contracts are called “Turing complete”. This means that they are fully functional and can perform any computation that you can do in any other programming language.
* Each mining computer will run the smart contract on their computer using their Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the mining process, and come to a conclusion about the output. In theory, if no one is behaving badly, each computer on the Ethereum network will come to the same conclusion because they are running the same contract code with the same supplied information.
* Accounts that only store ETH – these are similar to Bitcoin addresses and are sometimes known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). You make payments from these accounts by signing transactions with the appropriate private key.
* * Accounts that store ETH and have code (smart contracts) that can be run – these smart contracts are activated by a transaction sending ETH into it. Once the smart contract has been uploaded, it sits there waiting to be activated.
* When you activate a smart contract, you ask all the miners in the whole network to each individually perform the calculations within it. This costs them time and energy, and Gas is the mechanism by which you pay them for that service.
