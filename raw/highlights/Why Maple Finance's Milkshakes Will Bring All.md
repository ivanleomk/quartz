## Highlights
* In Maple’s protocol, Pool Delegates replace these credit teams. Delegates are firms/individuals with years of experience in credit risk assessment and asset management in the tradfi world. In order to be allowed on the Maple platform, the wannabe Delegate must be vetted and approved (whitelisted) by the Maple team, who looks at their background and track record.
* Delegates perform due diligence, negotiate terms with the prospective Borrower, and monitor the ongoing health of their Pool’s loan portfolio. In return, Delegates receive a portion of fees earned by their Pool - essentially a performance fee.
* Theoretically, we could reach a point where Borrowers have enough on-chain evidence of high performing loans (e.g. no defaults, years of on-time interest payments), that the diligence/underwriting process might be nearly instantaneous. I
* not every individual/business has the capital to lock away upfront in order to get access to much needed financing. With Maple’s model, firms can access financing with very little (or no) collateral required. I argue the whole DeFi space will mature faster now that solutions like Maple are available.
