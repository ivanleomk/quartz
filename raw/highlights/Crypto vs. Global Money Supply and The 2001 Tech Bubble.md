## Highlights
* The guys who called Bitcoin “Tulips” are done. They have no chance of saying that publicly without being laughed at. However, the people who suggest prices are high can say this and maintain “face”.
* If fiat currencies are printed it means that the prices of goods must go up.
* Roughly speaking, we’re sitting at a global money supply of $96T which is up from $78T (in just over a year! +23%).
