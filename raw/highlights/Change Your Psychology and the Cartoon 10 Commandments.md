## Highlights
* In short, the less needy you are and the less you care = immense growth. Luck does not favor the needy.
* If you are in bad health, you can’t use the money and you can’t even make more money. That’s how important health is.
* your 20s you can hit the clubs, party until 2am and be perfectly fine by 7am.
* Making money is *never* zero sum. There is always opportunity for wealth and if you are *unhappy* when someone you know succeeds, you’re the problem and you are are parasite.
* Do not go through life believing that there is no greater power as you will need some positive belief if you wish to survive the ugliest of all situations (physical injuries, mental trauma, 20 hour work days here and there, etc.).
* In short, if you never learn to spend to earn… you’ll never be rich. This is a comment referring to both money and social life. Few.
* You cannot save everyone. Life is too short to try and save everyone. You should try to save people with talent and skills not the guy who is cheering/praying for you to fall (loser/scarcity mentality).
* Over the long-term if you put in 100% effort you’ll make it to the top 5% at minimum.
* If you don’t need anything the world gives you everything. This is part of the reason we took this massive risk.
