## Highlights
* When you’re young and nimble like a jet ski, always choose the options that open the most doors for you.
* Experience wins when comparing a 4.0 GPA student to even a 3.4 GPA student. Go back to the first paragraph: “who can do this job with the least amount of errors on day one”
* answer. Do you want to get rich or do you want to live a upper middle class lifestyle. If you want to become rich you choose the one with the lower amount of hours with similar pay.
* Always choose the one that offers a bit better lifestyle so you can focus on building an affiliate marketing income stream, e-commerce income stream or something else. It will *EASILY* make up for the $10,000-20,000 pre-tax total compensation difference.
* You want to be well liked by the guys bringing in the most money. If you are the “support” guy for four people and you know that person A and person B bring in 80% of the office revenue… you get the idea.
* It takes about six months to put in a solid foundation. After that you should take your foot off the gas a bit and simply maintain your good standing with the winners at the firm.
* 1) make the life of the assistant easier – all expenses should be error free and done to save him/her as much time as possible, 2) organize all of your passwords with either 1password or an excel sheet that is locked with all of your passwords, 3) figure out the highest ROI places to eat for your meal expenses if you work in a high paying career, 4) research and make sure you’re taking advantage of all perks – 401K, medical, dental, discounts etc. and 5) front run all of the annoying internal things you may have to do – standardized tests for example.
* The 3-4 year metric assumes you’re pretty talented and will only quit if you are making 2x your career income. You *never* quit until you’re making at least double from your business line.
