## Highlights
* But "mentorship" feels very formal. It carries a connotation of a fixed cadence and time commitment. From the mentor's perspective, it feels like a big commitment. Furthermore, having one formal mentor often falls short
* When you screw up, own it. Then build a system so it never happens again.
* Companies have boardsâ€”ideally comprised of individuals from varying backgrounds and arenas. The board isn't involved in the day-to-day, but provides advice on strategy, key decisions, and challenges. Your Personal Board of Advisors is a group of 5-10 individuals. Important features: * Unbiased (not family) * Diverse experiences and backgrounds * Willing to provide raw feedback Over time, you can add and subtract from your board. The members don't need to know each other or that they are on your board. Informality is a feature, not a bug.
