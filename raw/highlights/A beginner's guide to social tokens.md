## Highlights
* Social tokens are tokens issued by individual creators or communities that enable community members to collaborate and share ownership in the value created together.
* NFTs are unique assets that are represented as a token such as a digital art piece or a plot of virtual land.
* While NFTs are “non-fungible” meaning that each item is unique, social tokens are “fungible” meaning that each individual token can be exchanged for another of the same token.
* Social tokens can be used to represent a wide range of access rights, from a person’s time, access to an exclusive group, or partial ownership of a community treasury. Their use cases can also evolve, with more features added over time.
