## Highlights
* A type guard is a TypeScript technique used to get information about the type of a variable, usually within a conditional block.
* Type guards have the unique property of assuring that the value tested is of a set type depending on the returned boolean.
* Type guards enable you to instruct the TypeScript compiler to infer a specific type for a variable in a particular context, ensuring that the type of an argument is what you say it is.
