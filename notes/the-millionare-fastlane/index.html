<blockquote>
<p>This is a book which depicts some strategies on how to make good money and in the proccess begin to work towards financial freedom</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=get-rich-old>Get Rich Old</h1>
<p>The traditional advice is to go to school, get good grades and then sometime when you are 65 years old, you will be rich. In short, sacrifice your today, your dreams and your life for a plan that pays dividends after most of your life has evaporated.</p>
<p>Get rich slow takes a lifetime to travel and its success is nefariously dependent on too many factors you cannot control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real golden years of life are when you&rsquo;re young, sentient and vibrant</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=mindsets>Mindsets</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The millionare fastlane is a dark, deserted, unpaved road strewn with potholes that force change and evolution. If the road trip to wealth were easy, wouldn&rsquo;t everybody be wealthy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your current financial situation is a product of your existing roadmap, whether chosen or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three main roadmaps</p>
<ul>
<li>Sidewalk - Poverty</li>
<li>Slowlane - Mediocrity</li>
<li>Fastlane - Wealth</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=sidewalkers>Sidewalkers</h2>
<p>Most people are lifelong sidewalkers - a contract for a pleasurable today in lieu of a more secure tomorrow. Sidewalkers are carelessly trapped in a &ldquo;Lifestyle Servitude&rdquo; fed by an urgent, insatiable need for pleasure, image and instant gratitifcation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>61% of all individuals who earned income earned less than $35,000 a year. A life on the Sidewalk naturally pulls you to poverty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sidewalker has a wealth equation of</p>
<p>$$
Wealth = Income + Debt
$$
Sidewalkers create their lifestyle in direct proportion to their income and supplement that lifestyle with extensive use of debt. They make large incomes, with e very dime spent on the next lavish accoutrement.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to have good financial planing.</p>
<h3 id=sidewalkers-and-luck>Sidewalkers and Luck</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sidewalkers manifesto is predicated on hithiking. When things don&rsquo;t work out as intended, blame unto others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidewalkers want the easy life and want someone else to pay for it. They are victims of life because life dealt them a bad hand and vote for populist policies. <strong>Immunization for victimitis occurs when you are both responsible for AND accountable to your actions and the possible poor consequences of those actions. Own your mistakes, failuires and triumphs</strong></p>
<h2 id=slowlane>Slowlane</h2>
<p>The slowlane is a sacrifice of today in the hopes of a brighter and freer tomorrow. You&rsquo;re constantly deluged with a series of doctrines that plead discipline to the trade-off. Future crutches often justify pleasurable nows and behind the scenes, Lifestyle Servitude swells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slowlane is a lifetime wager that a sacrificial today will yield a wealthier tomorrow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The driving force behind wealth under GetRichSlow is time - time employed at the job and time invested in the markets.</p>
<p>$$
Wealth = Job + Market \space{} Investments
$$
Ultimately, life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People glorify friday evenings because they celebrate the dividends of their trade - five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of unadulterated freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The slowlane is rooted in Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You put your faith into a plan which has variables which cannot be controlled nor leveraged. This is important because to attract large sums of money, you need two things - Control and Leverage.</p>
<h3 id=a-job>A Job</h3>
<p>Money is earned in a job via intrinsic value. This is determined by the marketplace and is the price at which you can trade your time for money. This is what you earn working a job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because intrinsic value is measured in terms of time, and we have a limited 24 hours of time, we cannot leverage a job to make good money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because your time is limited to a small number and cannot be leveraged, the mathematics of a job are wealth punitive. <strong>Small numbers do not make millionares</strong>.</p>
<h3 id=investments>Investments</h3>
<p>Compound Interest relies heavily on time, good amounts of yearly investment yield and an invested sum which is repeatedly invested. In other words</p>
<p>$$
\text{Compound Interest = Invested Sum}\times(1 + \text{yield})^{\text{time}}
$$
Neither time nor yield can be leveraged or controlled, as a result, this is a surefoot step to disaster.</p>
<h3 id=education>Education</h3>
<p>The slowlane sometimes deploys education as a way in order to increase their intrinsic value (Eg. getting an MBA) to increase their rate. However, they&rsquo;re still trading their time for money and this doesn&rsquo;t allow you to increase the amount of $$ you&rsquo;re earning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with formal education to raise intrinsic value is that it is extremely time and money intensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you financed your advanced education with debt, the debt becomes parasitic and traps you into forced job servitude and that destroys freedom. Whether you owe $35,000 for your BMW or for student loans, debt steals freedom and forces indentured time.</p>
<h3 id=gurus>Gurus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A paradox of practice exists when someone promotes a moneymaking strategy but that strategy is not what made him or her rich. In other words, they&rsquo;re not practitioners of their own advice. They effectively teach one wealth equation while they get rich leveraging another.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=slowlane-dangers>Slowlane Dangers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Wealth</li>
<li>Home prices</li>
<li>Company going bust</li>
<li>Lifestyle creep</li>
<li>Slow walk~</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=wealth>Wealth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth must be defined by the three trinity of things - Fitness, Family and Freedom. Luxury is but one small aspect of that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many individuals who look wealthy with the use of easy credit and long-term monthly financing options. But this comes at a huge cost, unaffordable material possessions have consequences to our health and relationships.</p>
<p>Looking wealthy is an enemy to real wealth - it destroys freedom, it destroys health and it destroys relationships. When we engage in more extravagant spending, we spend up reducing the amount of freedom that we have and detract away from real wealth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re held hostage to your lifestyle, you aren&rsquo;t wealthy because you lack freedom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money doesn&rsquo;t buy happiness when its misused. Instead, it buys bondage. Used properly, money buys freedom and in turn, choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy , energy and even some hair.</p>
<h2 id=affordability>Affordability</h2>
<p>Affordability is when you don&rsquo;t have to think about it. If you have to think about affordability, you can&rsquo;t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy things that you cannot afford. When that happens, instead of you owning your stuff, your stuff owns you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defend yourself by exposing the hook beneath the bait, the bucket of bondage which is lifestyle servitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=jobs>Jobs</h2>
<p>Jobs suck because they limit because they&rsquo;re rooted in limited leverage and limited control, which mean they&rsquo;re severely limited in the scope of wealth.</p>
<ul>
<li>To trade time is to trade life : You sell your freedom to consume time</li>
<li>Jobs limit the experience and skillsets that you&rsquo;re able to learn</li>
<li>With a job, you&rsquo;re forced to play along to someone else&rsquo;s fiddle</li>
<li>As an employee, your value is dictated and the job becomes a wealth delimiter with limits that cannot be subverted</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, in a job we are selling our freedom ( in the form of time ) for money which gives us freedom. If we cannot control our primary income source, wealth accumulation becomes thwarted.</p>
<h1 id=the-roadmap>The Roadmap</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy characterised by Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL), hence creating an optimal environment for rapid wealth creation and extraordinary lifestyles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires new mindset changes</p>
<ol>
<li>Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money</li>
<li>The moment I stop learning is the moment I stop growing. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey.</li>
<li>Money is everywhere and its extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I&rsquo;ve touched. Money reflects the value I&rsquo;ve created.</li>
<li>The more I help, the richer I become in time, money and personal fufilment</li>
<li>Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility and I choose how I react to my circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to build a better system and contraption that will leverage your work. We want to construct a system that does it for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=actionable-steps>Actionable Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>When you encounter an advertising message that coaxes you to buy something, examine it from the producer perspective. How does this company make money? What is the aim of its message? Is this company making a profit?</li>
<li>You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value. A business is the key to the equation because it unlocks leverage, which swaps ULL for CUL.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-business>Why Business?</h2>
<p>A business can survive time and is capable of earning income long after my original time investment. When you unlock yourself from the handcuffs of time, you can control and leverage larger amounts of money.</p>
<p>$$
\text{Wealth} = \text{Net Profit} + \text{Asset Value}
$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rich accelerate wealth by accelerating asset value and selling those upgraded assets in the marketplace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>$$
\text{Asset Value} = (\text{Net Profit} + \text{Industry Multiplier})
$$</p>
<p>The goal is to ultimately <strong>divorce your wealth from your time</strong>. When your wealth is predicated on factors that you cannot control, you aren&rsquo;t going to make fast progress. You aren&rsquo;t in control, because time is in control.</p>
<p>There are five business seedlings to money trees</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rental Systems</strong> : Real estate is an asset that can be manipulated and its value appreciated. Appreciative assets are cornerstones in the Fastlane wealth equation. Rental systems are powerful money trees because they are high on the passivity scale and survive time.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Systems</strong> : Using the internet to scale different offerings</li>
<li><strong>Content Systems</strong> : Systems of information which you can use to be able to distribute content. Content is ultimately an asset that is saleable, over and over again, and with each sale, the effective time cost declines while the hourly rate of return expands.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution System</strong> : Distribution is a means to move product to the masses. If you can create a large company to move product to the masses, you&rsquo;ll be able to leverage a large amount of money</li>
<li><strong>Human Resource System</strong> : Managing people</li>
</ol>
<p>Compound interest pays the bills and is your tool. It&rsquo;s your passive income source but is not responsible for your wealth. A saved dollar is the best passive income instrument after all but you need a lot of them.</p>
<p>$$
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Units Sold}(\text{Scale}) \times \text{Unit Profit} (\text{Magnitude})
$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale creates millionares. Magnitude creates millionares. Scale and magnitude creates billionares.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the vehicle for your own wealth and the mechanism for movement. You are responsible for making the journey and the first step in taking charge of you, is to own you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor choices are the leading cause of poverty. People don&rsquo;t choose to be poor, instead they make poor decisions that slowly assemble into a poorness puzzle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our choices have consequences that transcend decades</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can utilise two potential forms of analysis in order to avoid poor decisions and choices.</p>
<h3 id=worst-case-consequence-analysis>Worst Case Consequence Analysis</h3>
<p>Just answer 3 questions</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?</li>
<li>What is the probability of this outcome?</li>
<li>Is this an acceptable risk?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=weighted-average-decision-matrix>Weighted Average Decision Matrix</h3>
<p>Just answer 3 questions</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the factors that matter to you. Give them a rating from 0 - 10 for each</li>
<li>What are the rankings for each factor for the specific choice. Give it a ranking from 0 - 10</li>
<li>Choose the option with the higher score</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Lifespan = Free Time + Indentured Time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your free time is yours to spend as you like while indentured time is the total time spent earning money and preparing to do the work to do so. Indentured time is the ransom of your free time</p>
