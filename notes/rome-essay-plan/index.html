<blockquote>
<p>Thesis Statement : Water today is a right that we take for granted. For the romans however, acess to water was something which was competently handled and also political in nature</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Introdution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In pre-modern societies, clean water was a frequently scarce resource which was avaliable to few.
<ul>
<li>There existed different ways to hydrate yourself using methods such as Alcohol, boiled water and for the ancient Romans, fresh water that was running from aqueducts</li>
<li>Stagnant water was dangerous because of potential dangers such as breeding insects and other water borne diseases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>P1</strong> : Private Access to water is a highly politicised form of access and used as a way to demonstrate one&rsquo;s social status in the hierachy</p>
<ul>
<li>Citizens are given the right to have water freely through facilities such as the Trevi fountain.</li>
<li>A lot of attention was dedicated to ensuring that the water supply was well managed</li>
<li>Private access to the water suply was an important right which was carefully granted.
<ul>
<li>This was a right which could only be granted by the emperor to his subjects. We see evidence of this today through the use of inscriptions on lead pipies ( fistulae) which number around 800 in Rome.</li>
<li>Private access made up almost 38% of the avaliable water supplies that were provided to rome via the aqueducts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These grants were an imperial privilege that were reserved for the elite.
<ul>
<li>It was a much-sought after privilege to recieve the right to install a private conduit</li>
<li>Many of the individuals who were able to get access to these private sources belonged to powerful families.</li>
<li>A survey of existing lead pipes that remain showed that this group included families of former consuls, ordinary senators and a group of imperial feedman.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many of these individuals did not need this water supply for their personal use, instead they used it to have a domus that was provided with a garden, fountain and a private bath.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>P2</strong> : While we take water today for granted, the Roman development of the aqueduct was a ground breaking achievement in its time. Providing access to water and corresponding facilities such as public baths cemented the legitimacy of the emperor&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of an aqueduct was not an easy task
<ul>
<li>Very shallow incline to be maintained across a huge extent of land. So need specialists and engineers to build this.</li>
<li>At the same time, it required a lot of investment and a large amount of technical expertise.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roman Acqueducts were worthy of being one of the seven wonders of the world and were ranked by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as one of the most important achievements of Roman Culture
<ul>
<li>Roman&rsquo;s pride over their water system because it is testament to their mastery over nature. Most outstanding achievement is the sewers.</li>
<li>Public sanitation is a big quality of life improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was an entire separate governing body - the <em>curatores aquarum</em> - which handled the distribution of water.
<ul>
<li>Agrippa had access to a force of 240 slaves and freedman for aqueduct work. This was subsequently increased to 460 men from among the imperial slaves and feedman by the emperor Claudius, indicating the importance that the governing body played in helping to ensure continued access to this important resource</li>
<li>This was neccessary in order to guarantee the flow of water at all times which was further complicated by the constant need to repair the existing structures that made it possible.</li>
<li>Wear and tear was frequently observed due to inclement weather. This could arise as a result of freezing temperatures in the winter among other possible natural phenomena. The repair works were mostly done by a mix of private contractors and the public force.</li>
<li>Larger tasks would have been offered to private contracters while smaller ones might have been performed by the private force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The total length of the aqueducts is over 500 km and the estimated amount of water supplied was about 1 million m^3 of water per day.</li>
<li>This is an enormous amount of water and exceeds the consumption in some of the largest cities even today.</li>
<li>The emperor was expected to provide for his citizens and the imperial baths for instance, represented a form of luxury that the comoners of Rome could enjoy for free and that the emperor was expected to provide.
<ul>
<li>So that they can also enjoy the luxuries that the aristocrats also enjoy, especially given their small apartments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
