Xie](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Decentralized finance, also referred to as ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen.\n* a stablecoin is engineered to remain ‚Äústable‚Äù at exactly 1.00 units of fiat. Most stablecoins are pegged to the USD, but some are in other fiat currencies like the Chinese RMB.\n* For example, Maker is a system built on Ethereum that governs a decentralized stablecoin called DAI. DAI aims to be pegged at 1.00 USD. The way the peg works is that DAI can be ‚Äúminted‚Äù by anyone within the Maker system by locking up crypto as collateral (primarily ETH) and taking out a loan of DAI. The collateral provided needs to be greater than the amount borrowed so that the loan is overcollateralized.\n* Given functional stablecoins like USDC and DAI, we can start rebuilding pieces of the traditional financial system as automated smart contracts.\n* they allow users to directly lend or borrow from the smart contract itself, which dynamically raises or lowers interest rates to match.\n* The answer is that it‚Äôs a massively scalable application.\n* The main risks are related to smart contract bugs and crypto volatility, but the interest rates are also substantially higher than typical bank rates of 2% or lower.\n* Decentralized exchanges aim to address this by using smart contracts to reduce or eliminate middleman.The dream is fully peer-to-peer exchange of all digital assets.\n* Buyers and sellers pull liquidity from the smart contract directly and receive a price quote based on the token quantity desired and the liquidity available.\n* One issue with the decentralized lending and borrowing services mentioned thus far is that they require quite a lot of collateral.\n* One of the first applications would be building blockchain analogs of fiat-based credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that institutions like banks rely on for credit scores.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.879298666Z","tags":null},"/highlights/a-beginners-guide-to-social-tokens":{"title":"A beginner's guide to social tokens","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk](https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk)\n\n## Highlights\n* Social tokens are tokens issued by individual creators or communities that enable community members to collaborate and share ownership in the value created together.\n* NFTs are unique assets that are represented as a token such as a digital art piece or a plot of virtual land.\n* While NFTs are ‚Äúnon-fungible‚Äù meaning that each item is unique, social tokens are ‚Äúfungible‚Äù meaning that each individual token can be exchanged for another of the same token.\n* Social tokens can be used to represent a wide range of access rights, from a person‚Äôs time, access to an exclusive group, or partial ownership of a community treasury.

Remember in a peer-to-peer network there is no ‚Äòmaster‚Äô server and any computer has equivalent powers or status to any other.\n* Like Bitcoin, mining participants create valid blocks by spending electricity to find solutions to a mathematical puzzle.\n* Token ownership is tracked on the Ethereum blockchain, just like BTC ownership is tracked on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, though at a technical level they track them in slightly different ways.\n* In many descriptions, Ethereum smart contracts are called ‚ÄúTuring complete‚Äù. This means that they are fully functional and can perform any computation that you can do in any other programming language.\n* Each mining computer will run the smart contract on their computer using their Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the mining process, and come to a conclusion about the output. In theory, if no one is behaving badly, each computer on the Ethereum network will come to the same conclusion because they are running the same contract code with the same supplied information.\n* Accounts that only store ETH ‚Äì these are similar to Bitcoin addresses and are sometimes known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). You make payments from these accounts by signing transactions with the appropriate private key.\n* * Accounts that store ETH and have code (smart contracts) that can be run ‚Äì these smart contracts are activated by a transaction sending ETH into it. Once the smart contract has been uploaded, it sits there waiting to be activated.\n* When you activate a smart contract, you ask all the miners in the whole network to each individually perform the calculations within it. This costs them time and energy, and Gas is the mechanism by which you pay them for that service.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.879298666Z","tags":null},"/highlights/a-masterclass-on-performance-engineering":{"title":"A Masterclass on Performance Engineering","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.bowtiedfox.com/p/productivity?s=r](https://www.bowtiedfox.com/p/productivity?s=r)\n* Author: [BowTiedFox](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Productivity is often described as your output over time; more output, less time means higher productivity.\n* You need to clearly define your goals or you‚Äôll waste your time.\n* You need to have some kind of inspiration to wake you up in the morning to endure life‚Äôs daily struggles.

As\n* Every iteration of a test takes time away from production workloads. Out-of-production testing has a ramp-up and ramp-down between switching from test to production workloads. In-production testing can leave residual configs that might adversely affect workload performance.\n* With out-of-production testing, the challenge is utilizing downtimes from production effectively without affecting other maintenance tasks.\n* We‚Äôve observed that in-production testing can, within 15 days, detect 70 percent of the fleet data corruptions that opportunistic testing may take about 6 months to detect.\n* We implement this mechanism using Fleetscanner, an internal facilitator tool for testing SDCs opportunistically.\n* Opportunistic testing allows for tests to have longer runtimes (on the order of minutes), enabling a more intrusive nature of detection.\n* There are fine-grained controls to enable more frequent opportunistic testing cadences on tiers and services that are sensitive.\n* Because the testing here ‚Äúripples‚Äù through our infrastructure, the test times are 1,000x lower than the opportunistic test runtimes. Ripple tests are typically in the order of hundreds of milliseconds within the fleet. They are scheduled based on workload behavior and can be switched on and off per workload.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.867298649Z","tags":null},"/highlights/dj-brew":{"title":"D√©j√† Brew","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://getmatter.app/email/5179786/?token=5179786%3AfxUN8lDKgvp4wx6FyYMIxyZCYyA](https://getmatter.app/email/5179786/?token=5179786%3AfxUN8lDKgvp4wx6FyYMIxyZCYyA)\n* Published Date: 2022-04-04\n\n## Highlights\n* The ninth Starbucks location in the US voted to unionize over the weekend, yet another blow to the company‚Äôs campaign against organizing.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.879298666Z","tags":null},"/highlights/dont-write-just-in-plain-text":{"title":"Don't Write Just in Plain Text","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text](https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text)\n* Author: [Miris](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Prioritising the longevity of data can sacrifice the authenticity of what it tries to capture and preserve.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.883298672Z","tags":null},"/highlights/farewell-big-data":{"title":"Farewell, Big Data","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidias-next-gpu-shows-that-transformers-are-transforming-ai](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidias-next-gpu-shows-that-transformers-are-transforming-ai)\n* Published Date: 2022-02-09\n* Author: [Andrew Ng](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that‚Äôs why foundation models have arisen first in NLP.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.871298655Z","tags":null},"/highlights/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2":{"title":"From The Desk Of A Trader","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.cryptofootguns.com/p/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2](https://www.cryptofootguns.com/p/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2)\n* Published Date: 2022-04-09\n* Author: [Foot Guns](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Trading is a game of mistakes.

This is the number of months it would take to sell the current inventory, if no new homes were added to the market, at the current rate of sales activity.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.879298666Z","tags":null},"/highlights/the-scoop-inside-fasts-rapid-collapse":{"title":"The Scoop- Inside Fast‚Äôs Rapid Collapse","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-fast](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-fast)\n* Published Date: 2022-04-07\n* Author: [Gergely Orosz](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Sign-on bonuses are typically repayable when the employee quits the company within 12 months.

Moving served the vast pasture needs of their herds of sheep, goats, yaks, and horses. Though seemingly an endless grassland, the steppe was relatively arid.\n* The challenges of that scenario mostly had to do with the calories in a steppe warrior‚Äôs ration and the acres of grass required for a large herd of horses.\n* The documentary record for the Mongols on campaign varies, suggesting that each warrior brought along as few as two and as many as 18 horses. That‚Äôs an enormous variation, but most historians have settled on five or six, mostly mares, with some geldings. In addition, at least during the Mongol imperial campaigns, there is solid evidence for sheep being brought along with the army, even on its more rapid movements.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.871298655Z","tags":null},"/highlights/when-your-manager-isnt-supporting-you-build-a-voltron":{"title":"When your manager isn't supporting you, build a Voltron","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/)\n* Author: [Lara Hogan Author](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Here‚Äôs the bad news: no one person will ever be able to manage you the way you want or need.\n* Start these relationships by offering to listen over coffee, or giving them some space to vent.

If your input is less than your output you will lose weight \n\n\nWhat you want to be looking and tracking is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). You can estimate your TDEE by first getting your Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ).\n\nThe formula is\n\n\u003e 10 * weight (in kg) + 6.25 * height (in cm) - 5 * age in years + 5\n\nIn my case, my weight is ~76.5 and my height is ~170 so at 25 years of age, I am approximately working with a BMR of ~1707.5. I work out quite actively so i'd then estimate my TDEE by taking my BMR and multiplying it between 1.8 to 2.2. This gives me a range of 3073.5 to 3756.5.\n\nWe'd then need to weigh ourselves over a period of a couple of weeks in order to see how accurate this actual estimate might be. \n\n# Macros\n\n## Protein\nProtein timing will come down to preference. Keep protein to around 1-1.25 grams / lbs which is approximately 0.5-0.65 grams / kg. \n\n## Carbs\n\nCarbs are needed in order to derive the gyclogen to workouts. That's why when we go on a low-carb diet we rarely feel like we have a lot of energy.\n\n## Fat\nFat is important, we specifically want monostaurated and polyunsaturated fats that come from fish, flaxseeds, walnuts and other sources of high omega 3 fatty acids. Avoid your trans fat.\n\n# Goals and Macro Setup\n\n## Muscle Gain\nYou want to eat around 3-500 calories over mantenance for an adequate surplus. Ideally you want to stick to the increase in calories for about 12 weeks at least so that you can. build an appreciable amount of muscle mass.\n\nThe ideal metrics here are around .25 - 0.5 kg of increase in weight. \n\n## Weight Loss\nYou want to eat about 3-500 calories less than your TDEE.  You should start slow. The largest weight loss will be at the start when you lose water weight and some muscle gyclogen. After a couple weeks, this will stall and you'll start to see what the actual rate of fat loss is. \n\n# Mindsets\n## Cheat Meals\nCheat meals should be around once a week if you're below 15% body fat and around twice a month when you're above 15% body fat.\n\n## Food Composition\nIdeally, you'll want to have around 80% of your daily caloric needs with nutrient dense, satisating foods and 20% with things that would be considered \"junk\" food. You'll want to eat around 2.2-2.4 g of protein / kg of bodyweight.  That would be approximately 140g of protein for me.. ?\n\n## Strength Loss\nYou can make Strength Gains while working on a caloric deficit.\n\n# Interesting Alternatives\n\n## Mini-Cuts\nJust cut down to around 1200-1400 calories and stay there. Eugene Teo does this from time to time. Period of time for the cut should be a maximum of 6 weeks at most before going on maintanence for double that time after.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.863298643Z","tags":null},"/notes/erc-token-standards":{"title":"ERC Token Standards","content":"## ERC-721\n\n\n\n```solidity\ncontract ERC721 {\n  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);\n  event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);\n\n  function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);\n  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);\n  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\n  function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.863298643Z","tags":null},"/notes/fitness":{"title":"Fitness","content":"Fitness is a broad topic so i've chosen to categorise what I've learnt in these broad topics\n\n- [Dieting 101](notes/dieting-101.md)\n- [Cardio 101](notes/cardio-101.md)\n- [Hormonal Health](notes/hormonal-health.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.859298637Z","tags":null},"/notes/highlights":{"title":"Reading Highlights","content":"---\nA list of the 56 Articles I've read so far\n\n# Some Stats\n\n|Period|Amount Read|\n|","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.859298637Z","tags":null},"/notes/hormonal-health":{"title":"Hormonal Health","content":"# Testosterone Improvement\n\n\u003e Modern diets are overly processed and this results in an enviroment which is not conducive for testosterone levels\n\nTestosterone is mostly impacted by lifestyle decisions and you'll need to work and make the changes.\n\nProtocols include\n\n1.

Therefore they are resistant to tampering and can be used trustlessly. In Etherium, Smart contracts are written using [Solidity](notes/solidity.md).\n\nAfter you deploy a contract to Ethereum, it‚Äôs¬†**_immutable_**, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.\n\nThe initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. *This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity*. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.\n\n# Contract Problems\n## Ownership\n\nWe can utilise the concept of ownership in [Solidity](notes/solidity.md) in order to ensure that important changes or values that exist within our app can only be changed by specific users.\n\n## Gas\nIn Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called¬†**_gas_**. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.\n\n¬†Each individual operation has a¬†**_gas cost_**¬†based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total¬†**_gas cost_**¬†of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.\n\nTherefore we should look towards [Solidity Gas Optimization](notes/solidity-gas-optimization.md) as a means to reduce the overall gas cost of our functions for our users\n\n\n# Resources\n- [What are Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI)","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.867298649Z","tags":null},"/notes/solidity":{"title":"Solidity","content":"# Initialising A Program\n\n\nWe initialise a program by defining the compiler version and then initialising contracts\n\n```solidity\n// Define the compiler version you would be using\npragma solidity ^0.8.10;\n\n// Start by creating a contract named HelloWorld\ncontract HelloWorld {\n\n}\n```\n\n# Variables\n\n## Variable Storage\nIn solidity we have two kinds of storage for our variables, `Storage` and `Memory`. Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain. Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to your contract. Think of it like your computer's hard disk vs RAM.\n\nState variables (declared outside contracts) are by default `Storage` and variables declared inside functions are by default `Memory` type.\n\n## Generic Values\nWe can initialise variables by simply declaring them. Sample variables types include\n- `uint`\n\n## Structs\nWe can also create structs which will allow us to be able to create objects that have their own unique properties\n\n```solidity\nstruct Zombie {\n\tstring name;\n\tuint dna;\n}\n```\n\n## Arrays\nSolidity supports two kinds of arrays, dynamic and static arrays\n\n```solidity\n// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:\nuint[2] fixedArray;\n\n// another fixed Array, can contain 5 strings:\nstring[5] stringArray;\n\n// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:\nuint[] dynamicArray;\n```\n\nWe can also for instance create an array of structs\n\n```solidity\nZombie[] zombies;\n```\n\n# Functions\nWell, there are two ways in which you can pass an argument to a Solidity function:\n\n- `By value` : Create a copy of the parameter's value and pass to the function. Our function then modifies the value wtihout modifying the initial parameter\n- `By Reference` : Our function takes a reference of the parameter. Any changes to the parameter will therefore be reflected\n\nWe can declare a function as seen below. Note that all functions are public by default. We can delcare a function as private by using the `private` key word.\n\n```solidity\nfunction _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private {\n    zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna));\n}\n```\n\n## View Functions\nWe can also declare our \n\nSo in this case we could declare it as a¬†**_view_**¬†function, meaning it's only viewing the data but not modifying it:\n\n```solidity\nfunction sayHello() public view returns (string memory) {\n```\n\n\n## Return Types\nTo return a value from a function, the declaration looks like this:\n\n```solidity\nstring greeting = \"What's up dog\";\n\nfunction sayHello() public returns (string memory) {\n  return greeting;\n}\n```\n\nIn Solidity, the function declaration contains the type of the return value (in this case¬†`string`).\n\n## Calling Other Functions\nWe can call other functions by performing\n\n```solidity\nfunction createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {\n\tuint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);\n\t_createZombie(_name, randDna);\n}\n```\n\nWe can deal with multiple return types as seen below\n\n```solidity\nfunction multipleReturns() internal returns(uint a, uint b, uint c) {\n  return (1, 2, 3);\n}\n\nfunction processMultipleReturns() external {\n  uint a;\n  uint b;\n  uint c;\n  // This is how you do multiple assignment:\n  (a, b, c) = multipleReturns();\n}\n\n// Or if we only cared about one of the values:\nfunction getLastReturnValue() external {\n  uint c;\n  // We can just leave the other fields blank:\n  (,,c) = multipleReturns();\n}\n```\n\n## Function Invariants\n\nWe can also specify function invariants which must be adhered to by using the `require` keyword. This allows us to ensure that specific invariants are followed before any changes are applied to the mutated state of our smart contract.\n\n```solidity\nfunction createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {\n\trequire(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);\n\tuint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);\n\t_createZombie(_name, randDna);\n}\n```\n\n## Events\n\n**_Events_**¬†are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be 'listening' for certain events and take action when they happen.\n\nWe can first define events by doing\n\n```solidity\nevent NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);\n```\n\nand then emit and event on the blockchain by performing the function call of\n\n```solidity\nemit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);\n```\n\n## Modifiers\n### Visibility Modifiers\n\n- `Private` : Callable only from other functions inside this contract\n- `Internal` : Callable only from other functions inside this contract but able to be inherited\n- `External` : Can only be called outside the contract\n- `Public` : Can be called anywhere, both internally and externally\n\n### State Modifiers\n- `View` : No data will be saved/changed by running the function\n- `Pure` : Function doesn't read any data from the blockchain nor save any data to the blockchain\n\n### Custom\n- `onlyOwner` : \n- other assorted modifiers we can define\n\n```solidity\n// A mapping to store a user's age:\nmapping (uint =\u003e uint) public age;\n\n// Require that this user be older than a certain age:\nmodifier olderThan(uint _age, uint _userId) {\n  require (age[_userId] \u003e= _age);\n  _;\n}\n\n// Must be older than 16 to drive a car (in the US, at least)\nfunction driveCar(uint _userId) public olderThan(16, _userId) {\n  // Some function logic\n}\n```\n\n# Inheritance\nSolidity supports inheritance and this allows us to perform inheritance when we have multiple contracts.\n\n```solidity\ncontract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {\n\t//Contract Goes Here\n}\n```\n\n## Interfaces\nWe can also specify interfaces such that the compiler knows how to call specific functions which might not be defined in it's source code as seen below\n\n```solidity\ncontract KittyInterface {\n  function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns (\n    bool isGestating,\n    bool isReady,\n    uint256 cooldownIndex,\n    uint256 nextActionAt,\n    uint256 siringWithId,\n    uint256 birthTime,\n    uint256 matronId,\n    uint256 sireId,\n    uint256 generation,\n    uint256 genes\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis is useful when we want to reference contracts which are deployed on the blockchain but not in our source code as seen below\n\n```solidity\ncontract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {\n\n  address ckAddress = 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d;\n  KittyInterface kittyContract = KittyInterface(ckAddress);\n\t\n  // Other Stuff\n\n}\n```\n\n# Time\n\n## Solidity Timeoptions\n\nSolidity contains the time units¬†`seconds`,¬†`minutes`,¬†`hours`,¬†`days`,¬†`weeks`¬†and¬†`years`. We can utilise this in order to help implement potential features such as timeouts.\n\n```solidity\nuint lastUpdated;\n\n// Set `lastUpdated` to `now`\nfunction updateTimestamp() public {\n  lastUpdated = now;\n}\n\n// Will return `true` if 5 minutes have passed since `updateTimestamp` was \n// called, `false` if 5 minutes have not passed\nfunction fiveMinutesHavePassed() public view returns (bool) {\n  return (now \u003e= (lastUpdated + 5 minutes));\n}\n```\n\n# Payable\nWe can also specify and send ether with specific smart contract function calls using the `payable` modifier\n\n```solidity\ncontract OnlineStore {\n  function buySomething() external payable {\n    // Check to make sure 0.001 ether was sent to the function call:\n    require(msg.value == 0.001 ether);\n    // If so, some logic to transfer the digital item to the caller of the function:\n    transferThing(msg.sender);\n  }\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.863298643Z","tags":null},"/notes/solidity-gas-optimization":{"title":"Solidity Gas Optimization","content":"# Introduction\nWe want to minimise the cost of gas to our users because that'll result in a large amount of unneccessary expenses for them otherwise. \n\n## Using Structs\n  \nIf you have multiple¬†`uint`s inside a struct, using a smaller-sized¬†`uint`¬†when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage.

It's a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the ethereum blockchain. \n\n\nHere's a quick [Brownie Cookbook](notes/brownie-cookbook.md) for quick reference. \n\nWe can access information on smart contracts by using the contract explorer. We can then query the balance of specific wallets by using the `balanceOf` function w.r.t that specific token. We can also query this value with respect to the native gas token by using the `balance` function.\n\n# Contract Swaps\n\nWe can use the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function using the Uniswap V2 Router contract\n\n```\nfunction swapExactTokensForTokens(uint amountIn, uint amountOutMin, address[] calldata path, address to, uint deadline) external returns (uint[] memory amounts)\n```\n\nIt accepts the following arguments:\n\n- An unsigned integer specifying the number of tokens sent to the router\n- An unsigned integer specifying the minimum number of tokens expected from the swap\n- An array with token contract addresses, starting with the token sent to the router, and ending with the token expected from the swap. This array behaves similar to the array we formed in getAmountsOut(), and will require all intermediate wrapper tokens to be passed.\n- An address for the destination of the output tokens. This is typically set to match the user calling for the swap, but could be set to an alternative address.\n- An unsigned integer representing the deadline for the swap in UNIX format. UNIX formatted deadline represent the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970). This is an internal ‚Äúsafety‚Äù mechanism in the contract ‚Äî the Router contract will not execute the swap if the current block time has exceeded the deadline, which can protect you if the swap lingers in the mempool for an excessive time. By that time, your expected swap may no longer be profitable.\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Slippage\n\nSlippage is commonly described as the allowed price difference between the submitted swap and the executed swap. Common recommendations are to set the slippage to 0.5% - 1% for normal pairs, and up to 5% on low volume pairs.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.867298649Z","tags":null},"/notes/typescript":{"title":"Typescipt","content":"# Overview\n\u003e Typescript is an open source, typed syntactic superset of Javascript.

They record data in a way that makes it probabilistically impossible to modify or hack the system.\n\nBlockchains start off with a Genesis State when they launch. Bitcoin's genesis state happened in 2009 when the public network launched. Ethereum's Genesis State happened in 2015, when it launched.\n\nEvery transaction on a blockchain modifies the global state that is replicated across all nodes. Since there are millions of transactions, transactions get grouped together in blocks. Hence the name. These blocks are chained together in a cryptographically verifiable way so they are historically traceable.\n\nEach block stores a hash, the hash of the previous hash and some information. The original use of proof-of-work resulted in it being difficult to create new blocks. As a result, this meant that individuals could not easily modify the state of the blockchain.\n\n**tldr;**\n\nMiners create new blocks by using what is known as proof-of-work. This then allows them to propose new blocks to add to the entire network which will then cause the state of the blockchain to be updated across all nodes.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [What Is A Blockchain ( Youtube )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)\n\n# Web3\n**tldr;**\n\nWeb1 :  Read\nWeb2 :  Read-Write\nWeb3 : Read-Write-Own\n\n## Web 1\nThe first phase of the Internet, Web1, was mainly about providing the everyday consumer with online content and information. As consumers could only read information or content online, and not yet interact with it, Web1 was incredibly static.\n\n## Web2\nWeb2 is the version of the internet most of us know and use today. Where Web1 was static and ‚Äúread-only,‚Äù Web2 is ‚Äúread-write,‚Äù and interactive. Under Web2, the internet became more usable: web2 was dynamic and users could consume, interact with, and create content on the internet themselves.\n\n## Web3\nWeb3, the future internet we‚Äôre moving towards, is a decentralized internet. Under Web3, the internet is shared online and governed by the collective ‚Äúwe,‚Äù rather than owned by centralized entities. The Web3 world is one that has open-source protocols at its foundation. Web3 is about rearchitecting internet services and products so that they benefit people rather than entities.\n\n\u003e Web3 enhances the web we know today by making it decentralized, distributed, open, trustless and permissionless.\n\n\n# Eth\n\u003e Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which only supports the transfer of the Bitcoin token around the network, Ethereum is more general purpose.\n\nWe can program [Smart Contracts](notes/smart-contracts.md) on Ethereum using [Solidity](notes/solidity.md) which is its native programming language. The network itself is mantained across a variety of different computer nodes which come together to form the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\n\n# Crypto Wallets\n\n**Definitions**\n-  **Address :**  An address is a string of text generated using cryptography to represent your account on the blockchain.\n- **Private Keys** : A private key is like a password that contains a bunch of letters and numbers that allow you to manage the crypto held by your address.\n- **Seed Phrase** : A seed phrase is a series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that give you access to the crypto associated with that wallet.\n- **Crypto Wallets** : Crypto wallets manage the private keys for your addresses\n\n# Tokens\n\n\u003e A¬†**_token_**¬†on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules ‚Äî namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share, such as¬†`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`¬†and¬†`balanceOf(address _owner)`.\n\nWe can learn more about [ERC Token Standards](notes/erc-token-standards.md) here.","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.859298637Z","tags":null},"/notes/what-im-reading":{"title":"What Im Reading","content":"\u003e Here's a quick collection of articles I liked and read recently.

I'm open to rethinking it, but I also I need to take action and I need to do something and then you have an escalation of commitment, the more action you take, which it becomes harder and harder to rethink the sunk costs building up. You have other sort of escalations. How do you balance those two things between being open and also affording yourself the choices that you need to make to exist in an organization and seize opportunity? \n  Speaker 0: I don't know that there's a way to get the best of both worlds in every situation. I do think though, that you can create conditions that at least increase the probability that you end up both open and decisive at the same time, which is a sort of strange combination. So for ([Time¬†0:13:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2ed))\n    - Note: Goal is to be open and decisive - setting co dictions yo rethink\n- Speaker 0: ultimately will require a bigger investment of time. It probably requires more people involved too. Uh That time has an opportunity cost. And so maybe we feel like we're giving something up, I don't know about you. If I'm going to hire someone and commit to working with them, I cannot invest enough time up front to decide that that's a good choice. It's interesting to \n  Speaker 1: me to listen to you say that because what comes to mind is like, there are organizations that invest incredible amounts of energy, time money into this, their sports organization, all sports before they draft somebody. It's like, what is the person's character? How well do they recognize the place? How well do they, is it intuition versus professionalism on their part? Right. And they have these ways of evaluating ([Time¬†0:19:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2d8))\n    - Note: Example of interview process which is more algorithmic\n- Speaker 0: your ways of fixing those flaws. And I think ironically knowing that people might be a little bit on guard or a little bit suspicious actually lead leaders to be more authentic and to come in and say, you know what the whole reason that I'm going to talk about areas for growth is. I want to get better. And so the more honest I can be about that, the more likely I am to grow. And so I think it's the responsibility of people in power to open that door and keep it open right and this this step to prove right here is the stuff people told me I am terrible at, here's how I've benefited from hearing those things in the past. That's one of the best ways that you can show that you really mean it. I think when \n  Speaker 1: I asked this question about psychological safety, I actually presume to know what some of those ([Time¬†0:27:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea31a4f0c000e83ac10))\n    - Note: Leadership and psychological safety\n- Speaker 0: mistakes I made, when I talk about embarrassing decisions I've made. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to signal to our kids that it's okay to be wrong and it's okay to rethink the choices we've made. Uh that's to me, one of the functions of regret, right? I I think of most negative emotions as teachable moments and the whole point of experiencing them is you're supposed to learn something from what you did wrong so you can make it right in the future. And so much of regret is saying, okay, I did something that uh that lead to an undesirable outcome or that violated one of my values. And so how do I do this differently? Moving forward Instead of trying to deny these emotions? Let's actually listen to them and figure out what the lesson is in them. \n  Speaker 1: You mentioned rewriting the history ([Time¬†0:52:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2f3))\n    - Note: Parenting rewriting\n- Speaker 0: not just experiments, Those are those are real commitments. And I think this is as relevant to personal decisions as it is to running a company right to say, okay, before I go into a major decision, if it is both irreversible and highly consequential, then I want to spend a lot of time rethinking my own views up front. Whereas if it's pretty easy to reverse an undue or it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go forward and make the decision knowing I'll have time later and the opportunity later to second guess it. \n  Speaker 1: But it's not enough to just sort of convince yourself you have the opportunity, you have to be of the mindset that that's sort of almost what you're looking to do.

A cell press journal. Excellent journal. And the title of the paper is fasting blood glucose as a predictor \n  Speaker 1: of mortality lost in translation. And I'll explain what the lost in translation part means in a moment. \n  Speaker 0: But the basic takeaway of this study and I should mention \n  Speaker 1: that the first author of the study is Polly Yeah guru. \n  Speaker 0: P A L L Y Y A Gur you guru, \n  Speaker 1: polly Polly Yeah guru \n  Speaker 0: at all. The basic finding of the study is that in humans, higher blood glucose is associated \n  Speaker 1: with mortality. \n  Speaker 0: And in fact, if you look at blood glucose, resting blood glucose across ([Time¬†0:03:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b34c))\n    - Note: Higher glucose is correlated with mortality. resting blood glucose increases over time as we age\n- Speaker 1: different aspects of health. \n  Speaker 0: This is a large scale study. It \n  Speaker 1: was published in Jama, the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the \n  Speaker 0: very top \n  Speaker 1: tier journals in the \n  Speaker 0: area of medicine. And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up \n  Speaker 1: there meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard. \n  Speaker 0: This paper where chris is the first author, it's Gardner at \n  Speaker 1: All, Jama looked at weight loss in people following one particular diet versus another particular diet \n  Speaker 0: And this was a 12 month weight loss study. So it was focused specifically on weight loss, \n  Speaker 1: although they looked at some other parameters as well. \n  Speaker 0: And the basic conclusion of the study was that there was no significant ([Time¬†0:14:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b378))\n    - Note: No significant difference between diets for weight loss - what only matters is that of caloric deficit\n- Speaker 1: I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism \n  Speaker 0: and \n  Speaker 1: hormones and other factors that impact appetite, \n  Speaker 0: We don't have time to go into \n  Speaker 1: all those details now. Although you're welcome to listen to that \n  Speaker 0: episode as well. But we can briefly describe the overall conditions \n  Speaker 1: that are set in the body when we eat and when we don't eat. \n  Speaker 0: The key word here is \n  Speaker 1: conditions. If I can emphasize anything today, it's that what you eat \n  Speaker 0: and when you eat \n  Speaker 1: it set conditions in your body \n  Speaker 0: and those conditions can be very good for you or very \n  Speaker 1: bad for you depending on when you eat. \n  Speaker 0: In fact when you eat is as important as what you ([Time¬†0:19:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b33a))\n    - Note: When you eat is as important to why you eat\n- Speaker 0: So insulin and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down. Even if we stop \n  Speaker 1: eating, they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down. It takes time. \n  Speaker 0: This is very important because if you look at the scientific literature \n  Speaker 1: on fasting \n  Speaker 0: on time restricted feeding, it's absolutely clear \n  Speaker 1: that the health benefits not just the weight loss benefits, but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding \n  Speaker 0: occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time and that gives us an anchor for from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions \n  Speaker 1: in the body over ([Time¬†0:23:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b317))\n    - Note: The most important thing is to set the conditions that are best for brain or your body\n- Speaker 0: of one's day. So for humans that's typically in the \n  Speaker 1: early part of the day \n  Speaker 0: or the later \n  Speaker 1: part of the day, but not at night. \n  Speaker 0: Put very simply. There are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24 hour cycle is very \n  Speaker 1: detrimental to one's health. In fact, \n  Speaker 0: when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health when we see light, can enhance our feelings of well being or can diminish \n  Speaker 1: our feelings of wellbeing. \n  Speaker 0: I've talked many times before about this on \n  Speaker 1: the Huberman lab podcast that \n  Speaker 0: during the daytime you want to get as much sunlight and other types of \n  Speaker 1: bright light in your eyes as is safely possible. And \n  Speaker 0: then you want to avoid light in the middle of the ([Time¬†0:31:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4116b6164086c09b388))\n    - Note: Get as much light as possible in the morning\n- Speaker 0: when you eat is as important as what you eat In this study, they saw something really interesting which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit. \n  Speaker 1: things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that I'll talk about in a moment, \n  Speaker 0: but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular, stable so called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm. You may be surprised to learn that 80% 80% of the genes in your \n  Speaker 1: body and brain \n  Speaker 0: are on a 24 hour schedule.

So that's exciting. Taproot is will activate in november and not only will it have an impact on privacy scalability of the core protocol, but it will also impact, like I said, opportunities in smart contracting and it will allow us it'll sort of set the stage for future upgrades like any prev out which has relevancy for other sorts of increased functionality at the lightning network level. And that's quite important because when we're thinking about ([Time¬†0:06:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478662))\n    - Note: Taproot is coming to Bitcoin\n- Speaker 0: data center, software, cybersecurity, foundational sort of technologies and Bitcoin. I found Bitcoin in that sort of mind space. And so I saw Bitcoin first as a protocol as a technology that would be a platform for the proliferation of a new sort of app ecosystem. And you know, in that way I approach it really as a sound tech maximum, not as a Bitcoin maximalist per se. I also spent time in 2013 2014 looking at all coins. I I think that I was the second or third maybe VC two due diligence in the I C. O space even ([Time¬†0:09:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478667))\n    - Note: Her stance on bi coin\n- Speaker 0: Okay, so a couple things you said a couple of things there, I'll try to hit all of them. So you talked a little bit about the attention shifting to defy this space where 100,000 traders have permission list access to trade sort of the long tail of assets that they might not otherwise have access to and they can do that without having to go through a K Y C process. And you know, it's also interesting to see folks making money in a quick way and it attracts media attention now. On the Bitcoin side. What's been happening is that Bitcoin has been declared a legal tender in El Salvador, we've seen the folks in El Salvador used Bitcoin on a day to day basis by using the Lightning ([Time¬†0:16:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b6001147866d))\n    - Note: Big question about Bitcoin maximimalism\n- Speaker 0: see folks like thinks that taking advantage of that now to talk about some of the development in the side chain space, we maybe, I'll start with stacks, which is a side channel air one side chain, they define it as in the Bitcoin space that has fully functional smart contracts live as of january of this year. We're seeing contracts of up to a billion dollars in aggregate commitments be present in that environment. Recently it was announced that there is an accelerator built to fund companies that are that are building in the stacks ecosystem. You know, I think that my expectation is that we will see projects like a, you know, swap like ([Time¬†0:23:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba662))\n    - Note: Interesting developments in Bitcoin including Sphinx\n- Speaker 0: or in lieu of it being present on Bitcoin and liquid does that. So as an example, liquid has smart contracting capability through something called covenants, which just means that you can essentially programmed Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is programmable money, It is that at the base layer, that's, you know, one of the areas of popular fud that I've seen from this bull market is, you know, saying that Bitcoin doesn't allow for smart contracts. And of course, that's not true. Bitcoin. Smart contracting has always existed at the core protocol level, but the sort of smart contracts that you can do on liquid as well as of the side chains take it a step further in. Bitcoin has that with covenants ([Time¬†0:24:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478675))\n    - Note: Side chains in Bitcoin\n- Speaker 1: something resembling UNICEF or care about having N. F. T. S on the side change versus how much is it? Is it just to prove that it can theoretically be done \n  Speaker 0: well? Bitcoin owners are not a monolith, right? And so it doesn't, I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure frankly that I care what Bitcoin or that we should care about what Bitcoin Ear's which I imagine you're mostly referring to folks that are active on social media. I'm not sure that it matters what folks want. The importance of Bitcoin owners to Bitcoin is that they are, it's a stakeholder group in a multi stakeholder ecosystem. So you have folks that use the tech and that's ([Time¬†0:27:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba65d))\n    - Note: Do Bitcoinera even care about side chains\n- Speaker 1: So I want to actually ask you a uh about a controversy in the question of Bitcoin development and there is a view that you're on the board of blog stream. There's all these criticisms, even among Bitcoin is a blog stream that it exerts an extraordinary amount of influence on Bitcoin core development that there are all there are other ideas such as drive chains, which is a different idea for scaling ([Time¬†0:35:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6d2f0a4042f000f4d8603))\n    - Note: Hard Forks ba Soft forks","lastmodified":"2022-04-19T04:29:16.883298672Z","tags":null},"/readwise/tweets/tweets-from-trung-phan":{"title":"Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶","content":"# Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1506362585448296448/LJg8kVSD.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [@TrungTPhan on Twitter](None)\n- Full Title: Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶\n- Category: #tweets\n- URL: https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan\n\n## Highlights\n- 21/ We did it folks.
