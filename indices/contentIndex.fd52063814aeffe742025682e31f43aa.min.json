Choose money and youâ€™ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and youâ€™ll always want to look better.\n* Though the pursuit of status is a hard temptation to fight off, there is a simple way to prevent it from controlling youâ€”play multiple status games at once.\n* There is no rule that states that you have to judge yourself by a singular dimension, even if society suggests otherwise.","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:01:55.825267356Z","tags":null},"/highlights/dont-write-just-in-plain-text":{"title":"Don't Write Just in Plain Text","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text](https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text)\n* Author: [Miris](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Prioritising the longevity of data can sacrifice the authenticity of what it tries to capture and preserve.","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:01:55.825267356Z","tags":null},"/highlights/life-is-short":{"title":"Life is Short","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)\n* Author: [Paul Graham](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Then I had kids.

By making funcÂ­tions entirely self-contained as to input and output, it becomes easier to reason about the behavior of each indiÂ­vidual funcÂ­tion.\n* FuncÂ­tional programÂ­ming, however, suggests we should create and destroy these strucÂ­tures willy-nilly. But memory operÂ­aÂ­tions are never free. ThereÂ­fore, this prinÂ­ciple of funcÂ­tional programÂ­ming will always become impracÂ­tiÂ­cally wasteful for suffiÂ­ciently large memory strucÂ­tures.
