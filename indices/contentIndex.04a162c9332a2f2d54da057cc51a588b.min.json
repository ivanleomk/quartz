Appleâ€™s peers would be thrilled to hold just one of these presentations every year or two.","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:12:23.370535767Z","tags":null},"/highlights/Building-data-centric-apps-with-a-reactive-relational-database":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/)\n* Author: [[Geoffrey Litt *]]\n\n## Highlights\n* In data-centric apps, much of the complexity of building and modifying the app comes from managing and propagating state.\n* A reactive system tracks dependencies between data and automatically keeps downstream data updated, so that the developer doesnâ€™t need to manually propagate change.\n* We hypothesize this is because developers are used to interacting with databases over the network, where network latencies apply.","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:12:23.370535767Z","tags":null},"/highlights/Choose-Your-Status-Game-Wisely":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://ofdollarsanddata.com/choose-your-status-game-wisely/](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/choose-your-status-game-wisely/)\n* Published Date: 2022-03-29\n* Author: [[Nick Maggiulli]]\n\n## Highlights\n* My story illustrates how different communities value different things when it comes to conferring status.\n* Because whatever status game you choose in life ultimately determines what you optimize for. Choose money and youâ€™ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and youâ€™ll always want to look better.\n* Though the pursuit of status is a hard temptation to fight off, there is a simple way to prevent it from controlling youâ€”play multiple status games at once.\n* There is no rule that states that you have to judge yourself by a singular dimension, even if society suggests otherwise.","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:12:23.370535767Z","tags":null},"/highlights/Dont-Write-Just-in-Plain-Text":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text](https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text)\n* Author: [[Miris]]\n\n## Highlights\n* Prioritising the longevity of data can sacrifice the authenticity of what it tries to capture and preserve.","lastmodified":"2022-04-04T02:12:23.370535767Z","tags":null},"/highlights/Life-is-Short":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)\n* Author: [[Paul Graham]]\n\n## Highlights\n* Then I had kids.

By making funcÂ­tions entirely self-contained as to input and output, it becomes easier to reason about the behavior of each indiÂ­vidual funcÂ­tion.\n* FuncÂ­tional programÂ­ming, however, suggests we should create and destroy these strucÂ­tures willy-nilly. But memory operÂ­aÂ­tions are never free. ThereÂ­fore, this prinÂ­ciple of funcÂ­tional programÂ­ming will always become impracÂ­tiÂ­cally wasteful for suffiÂ­ciently large memory strucÂ­tures.
