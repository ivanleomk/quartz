Xie](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Decentralized finance, also referred to as ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen.\n* a stablecoin is engineered to remain ‚Äústable‚Äù at exactly 1.00 units of fiat. Most stablecoins are pegged to the USD, but some are in other fiat currencies like the Chinese RMB.\n* For example, Maker is a system built on Ethereum that governs a decentralized stablecoin called DAI. DAI aims to be pegged at 1.00 USD. The way the peg works is that DAI can be ‚Äúminted‚Äù by anyone within the Maker system by locking up crypto as collateral (primarily ETH) and taking out a loan of DAI. The collateral provided needs to be greater than the amount borrowed so that the loan is overcollateralized.\n* Given functional stablecoins like USDC and DAI, we can start rebuilding pieces of the traditional financial system as automated smart contracts.\n* they allow users to directly lend or borrow from the smart contract itself, which dynamically raises or lowers interest rates to match.\n* The answer is that it‚Äôs a massively scalable application.\n* The main risks are related to smart contract bugs and crypto volatility, but the interest rates are also substantially higher than typical bank rates of 2% or lower.\n* Decentralized exchanges aim to address this by using smart contracts to reduce or eliminate middleman.The dream is fully peer-to-peer exchange of all digital assets.\n* Buyers and sellers pull liquidity from the smart contract directly and receive a price quote based on the token quantity desired and the liquidity available.\n* One issue with the decentralized lending and borrowing services mentioned thus far is that they require quite a lot of collateral.\n* One of the first applications would be building blockchain analogs of fiat-based credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that institutions like banks rely on for credit scores.","lastmodified":"2022-04-16T03:15:38.623788027Z","tags":null},"/highlights/a-beginners-guide-to-social-tokens":{"title":"A beginner's guide to social tokens","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk](https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk)\n\n## Highlights\n* Social tokens are tokens issued by individual creators or communities that enable community members to collaborate and share ownership in the value created together.\n* NFTs are unique assets that are represented as a token such as a digital art piece or a plot of virtual land.\n* While NFTs are ‚Äúnon-fungible‚Äù meaning that each item is unique, social tokens are ‚Äúfungible‚Äù meaning that each individual token can be exchanged for another of the same token.\n* Social tokens can be used to represent a wide range of access rights, from a person‚Äôs time, access to an exclusive group, or partial ownership of a community treasury.

The annual percentage yield is the amount of additional value you accrue per year assuming compounding (i.e. reinvestment of dividends).\n* Thus, projected APY may or may not resemble actual APY depending on past and future market conditions. Mitigate this risk by understanding the time horizon on which protocol APY figures are computed.\n* Clearly, this type of service has intrinsic value: the ability to automatically cover, originate, liquidate, and close loans without a financial intermediary is valuable in and of itself: it eliminates the possibility of human error, allows greater capital efficiency, and so on.\n* Many protocols use the term ‚Äústaking‚Äù to refer to any locking-up-of-assets, but this is not correct. Staking, in its true sense, is to risk loss of value for potential gain of value.\n* By locking up your assets with a validator, you are earning yield by contributing to the security of the underlying network, which is intrinsically valuable, and you are risking the possibility of losses if the validator is dishonest or broken.","lastmodified":"2022-04-16T03:15:38.623788027Z","tags":null},"/highlights/theres-never-been-such-a-severe-shortage-of-homes-in-the-u.s.-heres-why":{"title":"There's never been such a severe shortage of homes in the U.S. Here's why","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089174630/housing-shortage-new-home-construction-supply-chain](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/29/1089174630/housing-shortage-new-home-construction-supply-chain)\n* Published Date: 2022-03-29\n* Author: [Chris Arnold](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* \"A lot of my tradespeople found other work, went and got retrained for new jobs in law enforcement, all sorts of jobs,\" says Claus. \"So the workforce was somewhat decimated.\"\n* builders for many years just weren't building enough to keep up with demand.

Moving served the vast pasture needs of their herds of sheep, goats, yaks, and horses. Though seemingly an endless grassland, the steppe was relatively arid.\n* The challenges of that scenario mostly had to do with the calories in a steppe warrior‚Äôs ration and the acres of grass required for a large herd of horses.\n* The documentary record for the Mongols on campaign varies, suggesting that each warrior brought along as few as two and as many as 18 horses. That‚Äôs an enormous variation, but most historians have settled on five or six, mostly mares, with some geldings. In addition, at least during the Mongol imperial campaigns, there is solid evidence for sheep being brought along with the army, even on its more rapid movements.","lastmodified":"2022-04-16T03:15:38.619788064Z","tags":null},"/highlights/when-your-manager-isnt-supporting-you-build-a-voltron":{"title":"When your manager isn't supporting you, build a Voltron","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/)\n* Author: [Lara Hogan Author](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Here‚Äôs the bad news: no one person will ever be able to manage you the way you want or need.\n* Start these relationships by offering to listen over coffee, or giving them some space to vent.

In return, Delegates receive a portion of fees earned by their Pool - essentially a performance fee.\n* Theoretically, we could reach a point where Borrowers have enough on-chain evidence of high performing loans (e.g. no defaults, years of on-time interest payments), that the diligence/underwriting process might be nearly instantaneous.

It's a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the ethereum blockchain. \n\n\nHere's a quick [Brownie Cookbook](notes/brownie-cookbook.md) for quick reference. \n\nWe can access information on smart contracts by using the contract explorer. We can then query the balance of specific wallets by using the `balanceOf` function w.r.t that specific token. We can also query this value with respect to the native gas token by using the `balance` function.\n\n# Contract Swaps\n\nWe can use the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function using the Uniswap V2 Router contract\n\n```\nfunction swapExactTokensForTokens(uint amountIn, uint amountOutMin, address[] calldata path, address to, uint deadline) external returns (uint[] memory amounts)\n```\n\nIt accepts the following arguments:\n\n- An unsigned integer specifying the number of tokens sent to the router\n- An unsigned integer specifying the minimum number of tokens expected from the swap\n- An array with token contract addresses, starting with the token sent to the router, and ending with the token expected from the swap. This array behaves similar to the array we formed in getAmountsOut(), and will require all intermediate wrapper tokens to be passed.\n- An address for the destination of the output tokens. This is typically set to match the user calling for the swap, but could be set to an alternative address.\n- An unsigned integer representing the deadline for the swap in UNIX format. UNIX formatted deadline represent the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970). This is an internal ‚Äúsafety‚Äù mechanism in the contract ‚Äî the Router contract will not execute the swap if the current block time has exceeded the deadline, which can protect you if the swap lingers in the mempool for an excessive time. By that time, your expected swap may no longer be profitable.\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Slippage\n\nSlippage is commonly described as the allowed price difference between the submitted swap and the executed swap. Common recommendations are to set the slippage to 0.5% - 1% for normal pairs, and up to 5% on low volume pairs.","lastmodified":"2022-04-16T03:15:38.615788101Z","tags":null},"/notes/typescript":{"title":"Typescipt","content":"# Overview\n\u003e Typescript is an open source, typed syntactic superset of Javascript.
