Xie](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Decentralized finance, also referred to as ‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen.\n* a stablecoin is engineered to remain ‚Äústable‚Äù at exactly 1.00 units of fiat. Most stablecoins are pegged to the USD, but some are in other fiat currencies like the Chinese RMB.\n* For example, Maker is a system built on Ethereum that governs a decentralized stablecoin called DAI. DAI aims to be pegged at 1.00 USD. The way the peg works is that DAI can be ‚Äúminted‚Äù by anyone within the Maker system by locking up crypto as collateral (primarily ETH) and taking out a loan of DAI. The collateral provided needs to be greater than the amount borrowed so that the loan is overcollateralized.\n* Given functional stablecoins like USDC and DAI, we can start rebuilding pieces of the traditional financial system as automated smart contracts.\n* they allow users to directly lend or borrow from the smart contract itself, which dynamically raises or lowers interest rates to match.\n* The answer is that it‚Äôs a massively scalable application.\n* The main risks are related to smart contract bugs and crypto volatility, but the interest rates are also substantially higher than typical bank rates of 2% or lower.\n* Decentralized exchanges aim to address this by using smart contracts to reduce or eliminate middleman.The dream is fully peer-to-peer exchange of all digital assets.\n* Buyers and sellers pull liquidity from the smart contract directly and receive a price quote based on the token quantity desired and the liquidity available.\n* One issue with the decentralized lending and borrowing services mentioned thus far is that they require quite a lot of collateral.\n* One of the first applications would be building blockchain analogs of fiat-based credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that institutions like banks rely on for credit scores.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.629028211Z","tags":null},"/highlights/a-beginners-guide-to-social-tokens":{"title":"A beginner's guide to social tokens","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk](https://linda.mirror.xyz/4PDBWBMpFFPVEsP5EGgg5to2AyEpEHEXasq_K0b-yYk)\n\n## Highlights\n* Social tokens are tokens issued by individual creators or communities that enable community members to collaborate and share ownership in the value created together.\n* NFTs are unique assets that are represented as a token such as a digital art piece or a plot of virtual land.\n* While NFTs are ‚Äúnon-fungible‚Äù meaning that each item is unique, social tokens are ‚Äúfungible‚Äù meaning that each individual token can be exchanged for another of the same token.\n* Social tokens can be used to represent a wide range of access rights, from a person‚Äôs time, access to an exclusive group, or partial ownership of a community treasury.

Remember in a peer-to-peer network there is no ‚Äòmaster‚Äô server and any computer has equivalent powers or status to any other.\n* Like Bitcoin, mining participants create valid blocks by spending electricity to find solutions to a mathematical puzzle.\n* Token ownership is tracked on the Ethereum blockchain, just like BTC ownership is tracked on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, though at a technical level they track them in slightly different ways.\n* In many descriptions, Ethereum smart contracts are called ‚ÄúTuring complete‚Äù. This means that they are fully functional and can perform any computation that you can do in any other programming language.\n* Each mining computer will run the smart contract on their computer using their Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the mining process, and come to a conclusion about the output. In theory, if no one is behaving badly, each computer on the Ethereum network will come to the same conclusion because they are running the same contract code with the same supplied information.\n* Accounts that only store ETH ‚Äì these are similar to Bitcoin addresses and are sometimes known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). You make payments from these accounts by signing transactions with the appropriate private key.\n* * Accounts that store ETH and have code (smart contracts) that can be run ‚Äì these smart contracts are activated by a transaction sending ETH into it. Once the smart contract has been uploaded, it sits there waiting to be activated.\n* When you activate a smart contract, you ask all the miners in the whole network to each individually perform the calculations within it. This costs them time and energy, and Gas is the mechanism by which you pay them for that service.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.633028249Z","tags":null},"/highlights/a-masterclass-on-performance-engineering":{"title":"A Masterclass on Performance Engineering","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.bowtiedfox.com/p/productivity?s=r](https://www.bowtiedfox.com/p/productivity?s=r)\n* Author: [BowTiedFox](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Productivity is often described as your output over time; more output, less time means higher productivity.\n* You need to clearly define your goals or you‚Äôll waste your time.\n* You need to have some kind of inspiration to wake you up in the morning to endure life‚Äôs daily struggles.

In-production testing can leave residual configs that might adversely affect workload performance.\n* With out-of-production testing, the challenge is utilizing downtimes from production effectively without affecting other maintenance tasks.\n* We‚Äôve observed that in-production testing can, within 15 days, detect 70 percent of the fleet data corruptions that opportunistic testing may take about 6 months to detect.\n* We implement this mechanism using Fleetscanner, an internal facilitator tool for testing SDCs opportunistically.\n* Opportunistic testing allows for tests to have longer runtimes (on the order of minutes), enabling a more intrusive nature of detection.\n* There are fine-grained controls to enable more frequent opportunistic testing cadences on tiers and services that are sensitive.\n* Because the testing here ‚Äúripples‚Äù through our infrastructure, the test times are 1,000x lower than the opportunistic test runtimes. Ripple tests are typically in the order of hundreds of milliseconds within the fleet. They are scheduled based on workload behavior and can be switched on and off per workload.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.629028211Z","tags":null},"/highlights/dj-brew":{"title":"D√©j√† Brew","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://getmatter.app/email/5179786/?token=5179786%3AfxUN8lDKgvp4wx6FyYMIxyZCYyA](https://getmatter.app/email/5179786/?token=5179786%3AfxUN8lDKgvp4wx6FyYMIxyZCYyA)\n* Published Date: 2022-04-04\n\n## Highlights\n* The ninth Starbucks location in the US voted to unionize over the weekend, yet another blow to the company‚Äôs campaign against organizing.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.633028249Z","tags":null},"/highlights/dont-write-just-in-plain-text":{"title":"Don't Write Just in Plain Text","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text](https://blog.miris.design/not-just-plain-text)\n* Author: [Miris](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Prioritising the longevity of data can sacrifice the authenticity of what it tries to capture and preserve.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.621028135Z","tags":null},"/highlights/farewell-big-data":{"title":"Farewell, Big Data","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidias-next-gpu-shows-that-transformers-are-transforming-ai](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidias-next-gpu-shows-that-transformers-are-transforming-ai)\n* Published Date: 2022-02-09\n* Author: [Andrew Ng](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that‚Äôs why foundation models have arisen first in NLP.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.625028173Z","tags":null},"/highlights/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2":{"title":"From The Desk Of A Trader","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.cryptofootguns.com/p/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2](https://www.cryptofootguns.com/p/from-the-desk-of-a-trader-2)\n* Published Date: 2022-04-09\n* Author: [Foot Guns](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* Trading is a game of mistakes.

The difference between the two is that **values are immutable while variables are mutable**.\n\n## Types\nIn Kotlin, we use types as a way to tell Kotlin how to use data. A type provides values from which an expression may be assigned.\n\nKotlin by default gives us the Types of\n\n- Int\n- Double\n- Boolean\n- String\n- Char\n- String\n\nWe can even specify the type of object we are getting by using different constructors\n\n# Data Structures in Kotlin\n\n## Dictionaries\n\n\u003e In Kotlin, a dictionary is known as a hashMap\n\nWe can declare a dictionary by using \n\n```\nval map = hashMapOf\u003cInt, Int\u003e()\n```\n\n## Lists\n\nWe need to explicitly delcare if we want a mutable or immutable list. If we don't say that we want a mutable list, we won't get one.\n\n```kotlin\nlistOf(1,2,3) // Immutable\nmutableListof(1,2,3) //mutable\n```\n\nWe can then proceed to add elements by using\n\n- `.add()` : Single item\n- `.addAll()` : Entire collection\n\nUseful methods include\n\n- `distinct()` : This returns a List which contains only unique characters\n\n\n## Sets\n\u003e A set is a collection that allows only one element of each value\n\n\nWe can create a set by using the `toSet()` ( List -\u003e Set ) or `setOf` constructor. The following are some useful methods\n\n```kotlin\nval intSet = setOf(1, 1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 4)\n\n// No duplicates:\nintSet eq setOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 9)\n\n// Element order is unimportant:\nsetOf(1, 2) eq setOf(2, 1)\n\n// Set membership:\n(9 in intSet) eq true\n(99 in intSet) eq false\n\nintSet.contains(9) eq true\nintSet.contains(99) eq false\n\n// Does this set contain another set?\nintSet.containsAll(setOf(1, 9, 2)) eq true\n\n// Set union:\nintSet.union(setOf(3, 4, 5, 6)) eq\nsetOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9)\n\n// Set intersection:\nintSet intersect setOf(0, 1, 2, 7, 8) eq\nsetOf(1, 2)\n```\n\n## Maps\n\n\u003e Maps allow for key-value lookups\n\n\nMaps are read-only. In order to make them Mutable, we need to delare them as `mutableMapOf`\n\n```kotlin\n\n``` \n\n\n\n# OOP\n\n\u003e Objects are used to hold data and perform actions.

It also helps keep the network secure from attacks.\n\nEvery transaction on a blockchain modifies the global state that is replicated across all nodes. Since there are millions of transactions, transactions get grouped together in blocks. Hence the name. These blocks are chained together in a cryptographically verifiable way so they are historically traceable.\n\nEach block stores a hash, the hash of the previous hash and some information. The original use of proof-of-work resulted in it being difficult to create new blocks. As a result, this meant that individuals could not easily modify the state of the blockchain.\n\n\u003e **tldr;**\n\u003e \n\u003e Miners create new blocks by using what is known as proof-of-work. This then allows them to propose new blocks to add to the entire network which will then cause the state of the blockchain to be updated across all nodes.\n\n\n# Miners\n\n\u003e Miners help to keep the network secure by ensuring that transactions are ordered and mantain a certain degree of cohesiveness\n\nIn decentralized systems like Ethereum, we need to ensure that everyone in the world agrees on the ordering of transactions.\n\nFor example, if Alice sent Bob 1 ETH, which he further sent to Charlie, the order of the transactions NEEDS to be as follows\n\nAlice --\u003e Bob 1 ETH Bob --\u003e Charlie 1 ETH\n\nAny other transaction order will not work, and it is important everyone agrees to this.\n\nMiners, therefore, are also responsible for validating cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain network and adding them to the ledger.\n\n## How to Mine\nMiners need to produce a certificate of legitimacy that all transactions in their proposed block are valid.\n\nProducing this certificate is a computationally hard and complex challenge. This is what all of [Proof of Work](notes/proof-of-work.md) is about. We will go more in depth about this in a later tutorial, but for now, just know that producing this certificate is quite hard. \n\nFor the miners hard work in producing these certificates and executing transactions, they are rewarded in the form of new coins. In Ethereum, when a miner successfully mines a block, they receive 2 ETH for their hard work.\n\n## Process\nMiners verify a series of transactions and then propose a block to be used. These consist of transactions from their Mempool.\n\n## Mining Pools\nMost individual miners do not have enough resources to set up huge mining facilities with thousands of GPUs and ASICs. Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources in order to increase their chances of mining blocks. If anyone in the mining pool succeeds at mining a block, the reward is distributed proportionately to everyone in the pool based on their computational power they contribute to the pool.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.645028363Z","tags":null},"/notes/brownie-cookbook":{"title":"Brownie Cookbook","content":"# Basic\n\n- Loading Dev Console : `brownie console --network \u003cnetwork_name\u003e`\n\n\n```\n(virtual) ivanleo@Ivans-MacBook-Pro degen % brownie console --network avax-main\nBrownie v1.18.1 - Python development framework for Ethereum\n\nNo project was loaded.\nBrownie environment is ready.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e user = accounts.load(\"test_account\")\nEnter password for \"test_account\": \n```\n\n- Load smart contract : `Contract.from_explorer(\u003cexplorer Name\u003e`\n\n```\n\u003e\u003e\u003e wavax_contract = Contract.from_explorer('0xB31f66AA3C1e785363F0875A1B74E27b85FD66c7')\n```\n\n\n## Smart Contract Workarounds\n\nWe can calculate the value of a smart contract's balance by using\n\n```\namount / (10**contract.decimals())\n```\nWe can\n\n## DEX Operations\n\n1. getAmountsOut\n\n\n\n```\n\n```","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.65302844Z","tags":null},"/notes/building-a-second-brain":{"title":"Building a Second Brain","content":"# The Foundation\n\n\u003e A piece of content qualifies as a note if it has been interpreted through your lens.

(eg.)\n\n```js\nconst Pet = ({ name, animal, breed }) =\u003e {\n  return React.createElement(\"div\", {}, [\n    React.createElement(\"h2\", {}, name),\n    React.createElement(\"h3\", {}, animal),\n    React.createElement(\"h3\", {}, breed),\n  ]);\n};\n\nconst App = () =\u003e {\n  return React.createElement(\"div\", {}, [\n    React.createElement(\"h1\", {}, \"Adopt Me!\"),\n    React.createElement(Pet, {\n      name: \"Luna\",\n      animal: \"Dog\",\n      breed: \"Havanese\",\n    }),\n    React.createElement(Pet, {\n      name: \"Salt\",\n      animal: \"Cat\",\n      breed: \"Siamnese\",\n    }),\n    React.createElement(Pet, {\n      name: \"Rosa\",\n      animal: \"Guinea Pig\",\n      breed: \"Papa New Guinea Pig\",\n    }),\n  ]);\n};\n\nReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\n```\n\n## How does React respond\n\nReact, much like how it's named, aims to react to user input events. When it detects that something has changed, it re-runs its rendering cycle.\n\n\n## Hooks\n\u003e Hooks are just a way of managing state in our frontend app\n\n\nBecause hooks are built in specifically to work with react's rendering, they cannot be called conditionally. As a general rule, if a variable affects the rendering cycle, we want to keep it in state. If not, we can store it in a singleton.\n\nWe can enforce this using `eslint` by updating our eslint config as \n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"eslint:recommended\",\n    \"plugin:import/errors\",\n    \"plugin:react/recommended\",\n    \"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended\",\n    %%This is the part to add%%\n    \"plugin:react-hooks/recommended\",\n    \"prettier\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": { \"react/prop-types\": 0, \"react/react-in-jsx-scope\": 0 },\n  \"plugins\": [\"react\", \"import\", \"jsx-a11y\"],\n  \"parserOptions\": {\n    \"ecmaVersion\": 2021,\n    \"sourceType\": \"module\",\n    \"ecmaFeatures\": {\n      \"jsx\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"env\": {\n    \"es6\": true,\n    \"browser\": true,\n    \"node\": true\n  },\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"react\": {\n      \"version\": \"detect\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## useState\n\nA classic example is that of the `useState` hook. \n\n```js\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nconst SearchParams = () =\u003e {\n  const [location, setLocation] = useState(\"Seattle, WA\");\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"search-params\"\u003e\n      \u003cform\u003e\n        \u003clabel htmlFor=\"location\"\u003e\n          location\n          \u003cinput\n            onChange={(e) =\u003e setLocation(e.target.value)}\n            id=\"location\"\n            value={location}\n            placeholder=\"Location\"\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/label\u003e\n        \u003cbutton\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/form\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SearchParams;\n```\n\n## useEffect\n\n```js\nuseEffect(()=\u003e{\n//some cool code\n},[//dependencies])\n\n\n```\n\n`useEffect` can be used to trigger changes when certain variables have changed. In the event that we are using certain timeout functions, we can use a cleanup function to ensure we prevent any memory leaks.\n\n```js\nuseEffect(()=\u003e{\nconst timer = setTimeout(()=\u003e{\n  console.log(\"hi!\")\n},3000)\n\nreturn () =\u003e clearTimeout(timer)\n},[])\n```\n\n\n# Useful things to Note\n\n1. When we can set NODE_ENV = development in order to make sure we only get debugging messages printed in prod\n2. React strict_mode is a way for the react team to phase out APIs by forcing developers to only work on stable APIs\n\n\n# Class Components\n\nWe can see an example of a class component below\n\n```js\nclass Details extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      loading: true,\n    };\n  }\n\n  async componentDidMount() {\n    const res = await fetch(\n      `http://pets-v2.dev-apis.com/pets?id=${this.props.match.params.id}`\n    );\n    const json = await res.json();\n    this.setState({\n      ...this.state,\n      loading: false,\n      ...json.pets[0],\n    });\n    console.log(this.state);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { animal, breed, city, state, description, name } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003ch1\u003e{name}\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003ch2\u003e{`${animal}-${breed}-${city},${state}`}\u003c/h2\u003e\n        \u003cbutton\u003eAdopt me!\u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf we update babel, we can effectively simplify the constructor method by using the following instead\n\n```js\nstate = {\n\tloading:true\n}\n```\n\nThis brings us back to our original idea of state as a self-contained pair of values and props as one-directional flows of data from a parent component to a child component.\n\n## Error Boundaries\nOne of the benefits of using a class component is that we can have use error boundaries.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.645028363Z","tags":null},"/notes/configuring-nextjs":{"title":"Configuring NextJS","content":"# Eslint\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: ['next/core-web-vitals', 'airbnb', 'airbnb/hooks', 'prettier'],\n  plugins: ['react', '@typescript-eslint', 'prettier'],\n  env: {\n    browser: true,\n    es2021: true,\n    node: true,\n  },\n  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\n  parserOptions: {\n    ecmaFeatures: {\n      jsx: true,\n    },\n    ecmaVersion: 13,\n    sourceType: 'module',\n  },\n  rules: {\n    'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off',\n    'react/prop-types': 'off',\n    'react/jsx-props-no-spreading': 'off',\n    'import/prefer-default-export': 'off',\n    'no-param-reassign': 'off',\n    'import/extensions': [\n      'error',\n      'ignorePackages',\n      {\n        ts: 'never',\n        tsx: 'never',\n      },\n    ],\n    'consistent-return': 'off',\n    'arrow-body-style': 'off',\n    'prefer-arrow-callback': 'off',\n    'react/jsx-filename-extension': 'off',\n    'react/function-component-definition': [\n      'error',\n      {\n        namedComponents: 'arrow-function',\n        unnamedComponents: 'arrow-function',\n      },\n    ],\n    'prettier/prettier': 'warn',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n# TsConfig\n\n```js\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\n      \"dom\",\n      \"dom.iterable\",\n      \"esnext\"\n    ],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"downlevelIteration\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\"\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# .babelrc\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"superjson-next\"]\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.645028363Z","tags":null},"/notes/damon-dominques-french-course":{"title":"Damon Dominques French Course","content":"Here are the notes that correspond to each individual chapter\n\n# Beginner Course\n\n1.

If your input is less than your output you will lose weight \n\n\nWhat you want to be looking and tracking is your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). You can estimate your TDEE by first getting your Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ).\n\nThe formula is\n\n\u003e 10 * weight (in kg) + 6.25 * height (in cm) - 5 * age in years + 5\n\nIn my case, my weight is ~76.5 and my height is ~170 so at 25 years of age, I am approximately working with a BMR of ~1707.5. I work out quite actively so i'd then estimate my TDEE by taking my BMR and multiplying it between 1.8 to 2.2. This gives me a range of 3073.5 to 3756.5.\n\nWe'd then need to weigh ourselves over a period of a couple of weeks in order to see how accurate this actual estimate might be. \n\n# Macros\n\n## Protein\nProtein timing will come down to preference. Keep protein to around 1-1.25 grams / lbs which is approximately 0.5-0.65 grams / kg. \n\n## Carbs\n\nCarbs are needed in order to derive the gyclogen to workouts. That's why when we go on a low-carb diet we rarely feel like we have a lot of energy.\n\n## Fat\nFat is important, we specifically want monostaurated and polyunsaturated fats that come from fish, flaxseeds, walnuts and other sources of high omega 3 fatty acids. Avoid your trans fat.\n\n# Goals and Macro Setup\n\n## Muscle Gain\nYou want to eat around 3-500 calories over mantenance for an adequate surplus. Ideally you want to stick to the increase in calories for about 12 weeks at least so that you can. build an appreciable amount of muscle mass.\n\nThe ideal metrics here are around .25 - 0.5 kg of increase in weight. \n\n## Weight Loss\nYou want to eat about 3-500 calories less than your TDEE.  You should start slow. The largest weight loss will be at the start when you lose water weight and some muscle gyclogen. After a couple weeks, this will stall and you'll start to see what the actual rate of fat loss is. \n\n# Mindsets\n## Cheat Meals\nCheat meals should be around once a week if you're below 15% body fat and around twice a month when you're above 15% body fat.\n\n## Food Composition\nIdeally, you'll want to have around 80% of your daily caloric needs with nutrient dense, satisating foods and 20% with things that would be considered \"junk\" food.

The gas unit is used to measure the amount of computational effort required to execute a transaction on Ethereum. Since each transaction requires some computation resources to execute, it requires a fee, commonly called Gas fees or Transaction fees.\n\n\nIn addition to user specified gas limits per transaction, the Ethereum network also imposes a limit on the maximum amount of gas (units) allowed in a single block.\n\n## Pre London\n\u003e Original Formula : `gas fees = gas spent * gas price`\n\nGas Spent is the total amount of gas (in gas units) that were used to execute the transaction\nGas Price is the amount of ether you're willing to pay per gas unit of execution\n\n## Post London\nOn August 5th, 2021 - the London Upgrade was implemented on the Ethereum network. This upgrade primarily introduced three benefits:\n\n- Better gas fees estimations\n- Quicker transaction inclusion\n- Burning a percentage of ETH being used as transaction fees\n\n Since Ethereum does not have an overall maximum supply (unlike Bitcoin, which has a maximum supply of 21M Bitcoins), the burn helps the ETH supply reach an equilibrium by not inflating it infinitely.\n\nIn addition to the base fees, the concept of tipping (priority fees) was introduced. As the base fees got burnt, the tip was there to compensate miners for executing and propogating user transactions. This is again set by most wallets automatically, though you can choose to set this manually. Higher tip transactions tend to get higher priority.\n\n\u003e New Formula : `gas spent ¬†* (base fees + priority fees)`\n\n### Variable Block Size\n\nThe upgrade introduced variable size blocks to Ethereum. Each block now has a target gas limit of 15M gas, but the size can increase or decrease along with network demand, up until a maximum of 30M gas.\n\n## Rationale for Gas\nGas fees help keep the Ethereum network secure. By requiring a fee for every computation executed on the network, bad actors are prevented from spamming the network.\n\nIn order to avoid accidental or malicious infinite loops in smart contracts, which would cause all Ethereum nodes to forever be stuck, gas limits on transactions set a limit to how much computation a transaction can use.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.645028363Z","tags":null},"/notes/gender-en-francais":{"title":"Gender En Francais","content":"- English still has genders in some words\n\t- Animals and gendered adjectives\n- Examples\n\t- Le riz\n\t- Le lait\n\t- Le portable\n\t- Le voyage\n- The concept of des\n\t- Example Sentences\n\t\t- Je dessine la fleur ( I'm drawing the flower )\n\t\t- Je dessine les fleurs ( I'm drawing the flowers )\n\t\t- Je dessine une fleur ( I'm drawing a flower )\n\t\t- Je dessine des fleurs ( I'm drawing ___ flowers )\n\t- We do not have an equivalent construct for des in english\n- Adjectives and their endings\n\t- \n\t\n\n\n\n**New Words**\n\n- Je le trouve marrant ( I find it funny )\n\t- \n\t-","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.65302844Z","tags":null},"/notes/highlights":{"title":"Reading Highlights","content":"---\nA list of the 59 Articles I've read so far\n\n# Some Stats\n\n|Period|Amount Read|\n|","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.65302844Z","tags":null},"/notes/hormonal-health":{"title":"Hormonal Health","content":"# Testosterone Improvement\n\n\u003e Modern diets are overly processed and this results in an enviroment which is not conducive for testosterone levels\n\nTestosterone is mostly impacted by lifestyle decisions and you'll need to work and make the changes.\n\nProtocols include\n\n1.

This allows all nodes on the Ethereum Network to agree on the current state of the blockchain, and secures the network against a variety of attacks.\n\n# Introduction\nUnder Proof of Work, [Blockchain Mining](notes/blockchain-mining.md) requires that miners in the network compete against each other to create new blocks full of processed transactions. This new block is then shared with the rest of the network and the winner to broadcast this transaction first earns freshly minted ETH for its hard work.\n\nThe race is won by whoever's computer can solve a computationally hard mathematical puzzle the fastest. The problem is computationally hard to solve, but very easy to verify. The solution to this problem is the 'certificate of legitimacy' we discussed in the What is Mining? tutorial.\n\n## Rationale\n  \nProof of Work protects against Sybil attacks by making miners put up a large amount of computational power as collateral, therefore having them expend a lot of electrical energy. This is done through the solving of the computation puzzle to prove that the miners are 'putting in the work'. This acts as an economic deterrent to Sybil attacks.\n\n## Work\nEssentially, we want to prove that the miners expended energy and computational power to compute the block. And, that they did so faster than everyone else. If we can prove this, it means that the miner essentially spent money and time (in the form of energy and computation) so they could get a chance to propose a new block.\n\nThe Ethereum proof-of-work protocol, Ethash, requires miners to go through an intense race of trial and error. The process goes as follows:\n\n- Miner selects a group of transactions to include in a block\n- The network then makes the miner to create a slice of data from the state of the network\n- This slice is then put through a hash to calculate a target value\n- Miners then try to use a combination of the target dataset, nonce and a couple of other values to find a number that is lower than the target\n  \n  `HashFunction(dataset,target, nonce,...) = desired Value`\n- Miners keep using trial-and-error to find a valid value for the nonce which satisfies this condition.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.657028478Z","tags":null},"/notes/protocol-list":{"title":"Protocol List","content":"Here is a list of things I am currently doing, feel free to give thoughts and comments\n\n# Morning\n\n- [x] 10 Minutes of French Reading + Annotations into Anki\n- [x] 10 Minutes of Reading\n- [x] 10 Minutes of Meditation\n- [x] 10 Minutes of Journalling\n- [x] 1 L of Water\n- [x] Coffee ~ 2 hours after waking up\n- [x] Supplementation ( Currently about 2000 IU vitamin D, 1 x Omega 3 )\n\n\nNight\n- [ ] 4 Eggs ( Providing Cholesterol for testosterone production)\n- [ ] 3-4 Brazil Nuts + Pistachios","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.65302844Z","tags":null},"/notes/seo-optimization-for-nextjs":{"title":"SEO Optimization for NextJS","content":"Here's a quick checklist for SEO Optimization\n\n- [ ] Create a new container in Google Tag Manager\n- [ ] Create a Google Analytics Account\n- [ ] Generate Sitemap of site and submit to Google to crawl\n- [ ] Add in tags into header of NextJS App\n- [ ] Add Domain into Google Search Console\n- [ ] Add property which is equal to","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.641028325Z","tags":null},"/notes/smart-contracts":{"title":"Smart Contracts","content":"\u003e Smart contracts are computer programs that live on the blockchain\n\nThese programs are immutable and distributed. Therefore they are resistant to tampering and can be used trustlessly. In Etherium, Smart contracts are written using [Solidity](notes/solidity.md).\n\nAfter you deploy a contract to Ethereum, it‚Äôs¬†**_immutable_**, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.\n\nThe initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. *This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity*. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.\n\n# Contract Problems\n## Ownership\n\nWe can utilise the concept of ownership in [Solidity](notes/solidity.md) in order to ensure that important changes or values that exist within our app can only be changed by specific users.\n\n## Gas\nIn Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called¬†**_gas_**. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.\n\n¬†Each individual operation has a¬†**_gas cost_**¬†based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total¬†**_gas cost_**¬†of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.\n\nTherefore we should look towards [Solidity Gas Optimization](notes/solidity-gas-optimization.md) as a means to reduce the overall gas cost of our functions for our users\n\n\n# Resources\n- [What are Smart Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI)","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.665028554Z","tags":null},"/notes/solidity":{"title":"Solidity","content":"# Initialising A Program\n\n\nWe initialise a program by defining the compiler version and then initialising contracts\n\n```solidity\n// Define the compiler version you would be using\npragma solidity ^0.8.10;\n\n// Start by creating a contract named HelloWorld\ncontract HelloWorld {\n\n}\n```\n\n# Variables\n\n## Variable Storage\nIn solidity we have two kinds of storage for our variables, `Storage` and `Memory`. Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain. Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to your contract. Think of it like your computer's hard disk vs RAM.\n\nState variables (declared outside contracts) are by default `Storage` and variables declared inside functions are by default `Memory` type.\n\n## Generic Values\nWe can initialise variables by simply declaring them. Sample variables types include\n- `uint`\n\n## Structs\nWe can also create structs which will allow us to be able to create objects that have their own unique properties\n\n```solidity\nstruct Zombie {\n\tstring name;\n\tuint dna;\n}\n```\n\n## Arrays\nSolidity supports two kinds of arrays, dynamic and static arrays\n\n```solidity\n// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:\nuint[2] fixedArray;\n\n// another fixed Array, can contain 5 strings:\nstring[5] stringArray;\n\n// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:\nuint[] dynamicArray;\n```\n\nWe can also for instance create an array of structs\n\n```solidity\nZombie[] zombies;\n```\n\n# Functions\nWell, there are two ways in which you can pass an argument to a Solidity function:\n\n- `By value` : Create a copy of the parameter's value and pass to the function. Our function then modifies the value wtihout modifying the initial parameter\n- `By Reference` : Our function takes a reference of the parameter. Any changes to the parameter will therefore be reflected\n\nWe can declare a function as seen below. Note that all functions are public by default. We can delcare a function as private by using the `private` key word.\n\n```solidity\nfunction _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private {\n    zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna));\n}\n```\n\n## View Functions\nWe can also declare our \n\nSo in this case we could declare it as a¬†**_view_**¬†function, meaning it's only viewing the data but not modifying it:\n\n```solidity\nfunction sayHello() public view returns (string memory) {\n```\n\n\n## Return Types\nTo return a value from a function, the declaration looks like this:\n\n```solidity\nstring greeting = \"What's up dog\";\n\nfunction sayHello() public returns (string memory) {\n  return greeting;\n}\n```\n\nIn Solidity, the function declaration contains the type of the return value (in this case¬†`string`).\n\n## Calling Other Functions\nWe can call other functions by performing\n\n```solidity\nfunction createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {\n\tuint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);\n\t_createZombie(_name, randDna);\n}\n```\n\nWe can deal with multiple return types as seen below\n\n```solidity\nfunction multipleReturns() internal returns(uint a, uint b, uint c) {\n  return (1, 2, 3);\n}\n\nfunction processMultipleReturns() external {\n  uint a;\n  uint b;\n  uint c;\n  // This is how you do multiple assignment:\n  (a, b, c) = multipleReturns();\n}\n\n// Or if we only cared about one of the values:\nfunction getLastReturnValue() external {\n  uint c;\n  // We can just leave the other fields blank:\n  (,,c) = multipleReturns();\n}\n```\n\n## Function Invariants\n\nWe can also specify function invariants which must be adhered to by using the `require` keyword. This allows us to ensure that specific invariants are followed before any changes are applied to the mutated state of our smart contract.\n\n```solidity\nfunction createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {\n\trequire(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);\n\tuint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);\n\t_createZombie(_name, randDna);\n}\n```\n\n## Events\n\n**_Events_**¬†are a way for your contract to communicate that something happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be 'listening' for certain events and take action when they happen.\n\nWe can first define events by doing\n\n```solidity\nevent NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);\n```\n\nand then emit and event on the blockchain by performing the function call of\n\n```solidity\nemit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);\n```\n\n## Modifiers\n### Visibility Modifiers\n\n- `Private` : Callable only from other functions inside this contract\n- `Internal` : Callable only from other functions inside this contract but able to be inherited\n- `External` : Can only be called outside the contract\n- `Public` : Can be called anywhere, both internally and externally\n\n### State Modifiers\n- `View` : No data will be saved/changed by running the function\n- `Pure` : Function doesn't read any data from the blockchain nor save any data to the blockchain\n\n### Custom\n- `onlyOwner` : \n- other assorted modifiers we can define\n\n```solidity\n// A mapping to store a user's age:\nmapping (uint =\u003e uint) public age;\n\n// Require that this user be older than a certain age:\nmodifier olderThan(uint _age, uint _userId) {\n  require (age[_userId] \u003e= _age);\n  _;\n}\n\n// Must be older than 16 to drive a car (in the US, at least)\nfunction driveCar(uint _userId) public olderThan(16, _userId) {\n  // Some function logic\n}\n```\n\n# Inheritance\nSolidity supports inheritance and this allows us to perform inheritance when we have multiple contracts.\n\n```solidity\ncontract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {\n\t//Contract Goes Here\n}\n```\n\n## Interfaces\nWe can also specify interfaces such that the compiler knows how to call specific functions which might not be defined in it's source code as seen below\n\n```solidity\ncontract KittyInterface {\n  function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns (\n    bool isGestating,\n    bool isReady,\n    uint256 cooldownIndex,\n    uint256 nextActionAt,\n    uint256 siringWithId,\n    uint256 birthTime,\n    uint256 matronId,\n    uint256 sireId,\n    uint256 generation,\n    uint256 genes\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis is useful when we want to reference contracts which are deployed on the blockchain but not in our source code as seen below\n\n```solidity\ncontract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {\n\n  address ckAddress = 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d;\n  KittyInterface kittyContract = KittyInterface(ckAddress);\n\t\n  // Other Stuff\n\n}\n```\n\n# Time\n\n## Solidity Timeoptions\n\nSolidity contains the time units¬†`seconds`,¬†`minutes`,¬†`hours`,¬†`days`,¬†`weeks`¬†and¬†`years`. We can utilise this in order to help implement potential features such as timeouts.\n\n```solidity\nuint lastUpdated;\n\n// Set `lastUpdated` to `now`\nfunction updateTimestamp() public {\n  lastUpdated = now;\n}\n\n// Will return `true` if 5 minutes have passed since `updateTimestamp` was \n// called, `false` if 5 minutes have not passed\nfunction fiveMinutesHavePassed() public view returns (bool) {\n  return (now \u003e= (lastUpdated + 5 minutes));\n}\n```\n\n# Payable\nWe can also specify and send ether with specific smart contract function calls using the `payable` modifier\n\n```solidity\ncontract OnlineStore {\n  function buySomething() external payable {\n    // Check to make sure 0.001 ether was sent to the function call:\n    require(msg.value == 0.001 ether);\n    // If so, some logic to transfer the digital item to the caller of the function:\n    transferThing(msg.sender);\n  }\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.665028554Z","tags":null},"/notes/solidity-gas-optimization":{"title":"Solidity Gas Optimization","content":"# Introduction\nWe want to minimise the cost of gas to our users because that'll result in a large amount of unneccessary expenses for them otherwise. \n\n## Using Structs\n  \nIf you have multiple¬†`uint`s inside a struct, using a smaller-sized¬†`uint`¬†when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage.

In short, sacrifice your today, your dreams and your life for a plan that pays dividends after most of your life has evaporated.\n\nGet rich slow takes a lifetime to travel and its success is nefariously dependent on too many factors you cannot control. \n\n\u003e The real golden years of life are when you're young, sentient and vibrant\n\n\n# Mindsets\n\u003e Wealth eludes most people because they are preoccupied with events while disregarding process. Without process, there is no event.\n\nThe millionare fastlane is a dark, deserted, unpaved road strewn with potholes that force change and evolution. If the road trip to wealth were easy, wouldn't everybody be wealthy?\n\n\u003e Your current financial situation is a product of your existing roadmap, whether chosen or not. \n\nThere are three main roadmaps \n- Sidewalk - Poverty\n- Slowlane - Mediocrity\n- Fastlane - Wealth\n\n## Sidewalkers\n\nMost people are lifelong sidewalkers - a contract for a pleasurable today in lieu of a more secure tomorrow. Sidewalkers are carelessly trapped in a \"Lifestyle Servitude\" fed by an urgent, insatiable need for pleasure, image and instant gratitifcation.\n\n\u003e 61% of all individuals who earned income earned less than $35,000 a year. A life on the Sidewalk naturally pulls you to poverty.\n\nA sidewalker has a wealth equation of\n\n$$\nWealth = Income + Debt\n$$\nSidewalkers create their lifestyle in direct proportion to their income and supplement that lifestyle with extensive use of debt. They make large incomes, with e very dime spent on the next lavish accoutrement.\n\nTherefore, you need to have good financial planing.\n\n### Sidewalkers and Luck\n\u003e The Sidewalkers manifesto is predicated on hithiking. When things don't work out as intended, blame unto others.\n\nSidewalkers want the easy life and want someone else to pay for it. They are victims of life because life dealt them a bad hand and vote for populist policies. **Immunization for victimitis occurs when you are both responsible for AND accountable to your actions and the possible poor consequences of those actions.  Own your mistakes, failuires and triumphs**\n\n\n## Slowlane\nThe slowlane is a sacrifice of today in the hopes of a brighter and freer tomorrow.  You're constantly deluged with a series of doctrines that plead discipline to the trade-off.  Future crutches often justify pleasurable nows and behind the scenes, Lifestyle Servitude swells.\n\n\u003e The slowlane is a lifetime wager that a sacrificial today will yield a wealthier tomorrow\n\nThe driving force behind wealth under GetRichSlow is time - time employed at the job and time invested in the markets. \n\n$$\nWealth = Job + Market \\space{} Investments\n$$\nUltimately, life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning. \n\n\u003e People glorify friday evenings because they celebrate the dividends of their trade - five days of work-bondage exchanged for two days of unadulterated freedom.\n\n\u003e The slowlane is rooted in Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL)\n\nYou put your faith into a plan which has variables which cannot be controlled nor leveraged. This is important because to attract large sums of money, you need two things - Control and Leverage.\n\n### A Job\nMoney is earned in a job via intrinsic value. This is determined by the marketplace and is the price at which you can trade your time for money. This is what you earn working a job. \n\n\u003e Because intrinsic value is measured in terms of time, and we have a limited 24 hours of time, we cannot leverage a job to make good money\n\nBecause your time is limited to a small number and cannot be leveraged, the mathematics of a job are wealth punitive. **Small numbers do not make millionares**. \n\n### Investments\n\nCompound Interest relies heavily on time, good amounts of yearly investment yield and an invested sum which is repeatedly invested. In other words\n\n$$\n\\text{Compound Interest = Invested Sum}\\times(1 + \\text{yield})^{\\text{time}}\n$$\nNeither time nor yield can be leveraged or controlled, as a result, this is a surefoot step to disaster.\n\n### Education\nThe slowlane sometimes deploys education as a way in order to increase their intrinsic value (Eg. getting an MBA) to increase their rate. However, they're still trading their time for money and this doesn't allow you to increase the amount of \\$\\$ you're earning\n\n \u003e The problem with formal education to raise intrinsic value is that it is extremely time and money intensive.\n \n If you financed your advanced education with debt, the debt becomes parasitic and traps you into forced job servitude and that destroys freedom. Whether you owe $35,000 for your BMW or for student loans, debt steals freedom and forces indentured time.\n\n### Gurus\n\u003e A paradox of practice exists when someone promotes a moneymaking strategy but that strategy is not what made him or her rich. In other words, they're not practitioners of their own advice. They effectively teach one wealth equation while they get rich leveraging another.\n\n### Slowlane Dangers\n- Health\n- Wealth\n- Home prices\n- Company going bust\n- Lifestyle creep\n- Slow walk~\n\n\n\n\n\n## Wealth\n\n\u003e Wealth must be defined by the three trinity of things - Fitness, Family and Freedom. Luxury is but one small aspect of that\n\n\nThere are many individuals who look wealthy with the use of easy credit and long-term monthly financing options. But this comes at a huge cost, unaffordable material possessions have consequences to our health and relationships.\n\nLooking wealthy is an enemy to real wealth - it destroys freedom, it destroys health and it destroys relationships. When we engage in more extravagant spending, we spend up reducing the amount of freedom that we have and detract away from real wealth.\n\nIf you're held hostage to your lifestyle, you aren't wealthy because you lack freedom.\n\n\u003e Money doesn't buy happiness when its misused. Instead, it buys bondage. Used properly, money buys freedom and in turn, choices.\n\nWealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy , energy and even some hair. \n\n## Affordability\nAffordability is when you don't have to think about it. If you have to think about affordability, you can't afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences.\n\nDon't buy things that you cannot afford. When that happens, instead of you owning your stuff, your stuff owns you. \n\n\u003e Defend yourself by exposing the hook beneath the bait, the bucket of bondage which is lifestyle servitude.\n\n## Jobs\nJobs suck because they limit because they're rooted in limited leverage and limited control, which mean they're severely limited in the scope of wealth.\n\n- To trade time is to trade life : You sell your freedom to consume time\n- Jobs limit the experience and skillsets that you're able to learn\n- With a job, you're forced to play along to someone else's fiddle\n- As an employee, your value is dictated and the job becomes a wealth delimiter with limits that cannot be subverted\n\nTherefore, in a job we are selling our freedom ( in the form of time ) for money which gives us freedom. If we cannot control our primary income source, wealth accumulation becomes thwarted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Roadmap\n\u003e The Fastlane is a business and lifestyle strategy characterised by Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL), hence creating an optimal environment for rapid wealth creation and extraordinary lifestyles.\n\nThis requires new mindset changes\n\n1. Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money\n2. The moment I stop learning is the moment I stop growing. Constant expansion of my knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey. \n3. Money is everywhere and its extremely abundant. Money is a reflection of how many lives I've touched. Money reflects the value I've created.\n4. The more I help, the richer I become in time, money and personal fufilment\n5. Life is what I make it. My financial plan is entirely my responsibility and I choose how I react to my circumstances.\n\n\u003e Ultimately, the goal is to build a better system and contraption that will leverage your work. We want to construct a system that does it for you.\n\n## Actionable Steps\n\n1. When you encounter an advertising message that coaxes you to buy something, examine it from the producer perspective. How does this company make money? What is the aim of its message? Is this company making a profit?\n2. You need to give birth to a business and offer the world value. A business is the key to the equation because it unlocks leverage, which swaps ULL for CUL.\n\n## Why Business?\nA business can survive time and is capable of earning income long after my original time investment. When you unlock yourself from the handcuffs of time, you can control and leverage larger amounts of money.\n\n$$\n\\text{Wealth} = \\text{Net Profit} + \\text{Asset Value}\n$$\n\u003e The Rich accelerate wealth by accelerating asset value and selling those upgraded assets in the marketplace\n\n$$\n\\text{Asset Value} = (\\text{Net Profit} + \\text{Industry Multiplier})\n$$\n\nThe goal is to ultimately **divorce your wealth from your time**. When your wealth is predicated on factors that you cannot control, you aren't going to make fast progress. You aren't in control, because time is in control.\n\nThere are five business seedlings to money trees\n\n1. **Rental Systems** : Real estate is an asset that can be manipulated and its value appreciated. Appreciative assets are cornerstones in the Fastlane wealth equation. Rental systems are powerful money trees because they are high on the passivity scale and survive time.\n2. **Computer Systems** : Using the internet to scale different offerings\n3. **Content Systems** : Systems of information which you can use to be able to distribute content. Content is ultimately an asset that is saleable, over and over again, and with each sale, the effective time cost declines while the hourly rate of return expands.\n4. **Distribution System** : Distribution is a means to move product to the masses. If you can create a large company to move product to the masses, you'll be able to leverage a large amount of money\n5. **Human Resource System** : Managing people\n\nCompound interest pays the bills and is your tool. It's your passive income source but is not responsible for your wealth. A saved dollar is the best passive income instrument after all but you need a lot of them. \n\n$$\n\\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Units Sold}(\\text{Scale}) \\times \\text{Unit Profit} (\\text{Magnitude})\n$$\n\n\u003e Scale creates millionares. Magnitude creates millionares. Scale and magnitude creates billionares. \n\n\n## What's Next?\n\u003e You are the vehicle for your own wealth and the mechanism for movement. You are responsible for making the journey and the first step in taking charge of you, is to own you.\n\n Poor choices are the leading cause of poverty. People don't choose to be poor, instead they make poor decisions that slowly assemble into a poorness puzzle.\n \n\u003e Our choices have consequences that transcend decades\n\nWe can utilise two potential forms of analysis in order to avoid poor decisions and choices.\n\n### Worst Case Consequence Analysis\n\nJust answer 3 questions\n\n1. What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?\n2. What is the probability of this outcome?\n3. Is this an acceptable risk?\n\n### Weighted Average Decision Matrix\n\nJust answer 3 questions\n\n1. What are the factors that matter to you. Give them a rating from 0 - 10 for each\n2. What are the rankings for each factor for the specific choice. Give it a ranking from  0 - 10\n3. Choose the option with the higher score\n\n\u003e Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.\n\n\u003e Your Lifespan = Free Time + Indentured Time\n\nYour free time is yours to spend as you like while indentured time is the total time spent earning money and preparing to do the work to do so. Indentured time is the ransom of your free time\n\n**Chapter 26**","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.657028478Z","tags":null},"/notes/trading-bots":{"title":"Trading Bots","content":"# Introduction\n\nNotes from my lil foray into automated money making~\n\n\u003e A smart contract is a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code and data that resides at a specific address on the ethereum blockchain. \n\n\nHere's a quick [Brownie Cookbook](notes/brownie-cookbook.md) for quick reference. \n\nWe can access information on smart contracts by using the contract explorer. We can then query the balance of specific wallets by using the `balanceOf` function w.r.t that specific token. We can also query this value with respect to the native gas token by using the `balance` function.\n\n# Contract Swaps\n\nWe can use the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function using the Uniswap V2 Router contract\n\n```\nfunction swapExactTokensForTokens(uint amountIn, uint amountOutMin, address[] calldata path, address to, uint deadline) external returns (uint[] memory amounts)\n```\n\nIt accepts the following arguments:\n\n- An unsigned integer specifying the number of tokens sent to the router\n- An unsigned integer specifying the minimum number of tokens expected from the swap\n- An array with token contract addresses, starting with the token sent to the router, and ending with the token expected from the swap. This array behaves similar to the array we formed in getAmountsOut(), and will require all intermediate wrapper tokens to be passed.\n- An address for the destination of the output tokens. This is typically set to match the user calling for the swap, but could be set to an alternative address.\n- An unsigned integer representing the deadline for the swap in UNIX format. UNIX formatted deadline represent the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970). This is an internal ‚Äúsafety‚Äù mechanism in the contract ‚Äî the Router contract will not execute the swap if the current block time has exceeded the deadline, which can protect you if the swap lingers in the mempool for an excessive time. By that time, your expected swap may no longer be profitable.\n\n# Concepts\n\n## Slippage\n\nSlippage is commonly described as the allowed price difference between the submitted swap and the executed swap. Common recommendations are to set the slippage to 0.5% - 1% for normal pairs, and up to 5% on low volume pairs.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.65302844Z","tags":null},"/notes/typescript":{"title":"Typescipt","content":"# Overview\n\u003e Typescript is an open source, typed syntactic superset of Javascript. It compiles to readable JS\n\nUsing typescript, we can write better programs which are easier to edit and refactor down the line.\n\nA good way to think of TS files:\n\n-   `.ts` files contain both type information and code that runs\n-   `.js` files contain only code that runs\n-   `.d.ts` files contain only type information\n\n# Cookbook\n\n## Functions\n\nWe can annote types by\n\n```\nfunction add(a : number, b:number):number {\n  return a + b \n}\n```\n\nWe can also indicate optional parameters by using the `?` operators\n\n```\nfunction add(a: number, b?: number): number {\n  if (typeof b === \"undefined\") {\n    return a + 3;\n  }\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\nWe can then use an optional \n\n## Dictionaries\n\nWe can type dictionaries with index signatures\n\n```ts\ntype phoneBook = {\n  [k:string]:{\n    country:string\n    area:string\n    number:string\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Arrays and Tuples\n```ts\nconst tupl:[number,number,number] = [200,100,300]\n```\n\n## Structural vs Nominal Types\n\n\u003e Type-Equivalence : is the type which is passed into the function or returned what we are expected to obtain\n\nType Systems can either be static or dynamic and this largely has to deal with whether type-checking is performed at compile or runtime. Dynamic type systems perform their type equivalence evaluation at runtime while static type systems do it at compile time.\n\nWe also have another differentiator which comes in the form of `Nominal Type Systems` and `Structural Type Systems`.\n\nNominal Type Systems aim to look at the inheritance pattern of certain clases and whether their names match whereas Structural type systems aim to look at whether the shape and property of the object matches what it is supposed to be.\n\n\n## Union and Intersection Types\nThey can conceptually be thought of as logical boolean operators.\n\n```ts\n#Union Types\ntype sampleUnion = \"success\" | \"error\"\n```\n\nA union type can only exist as a single instance of a category, it's useful to describe mutually exclusive situations. Therefore we can only access common behaviour that is guaranteed if we do not have a type guard.\n\nWe can use either\n\n- `instanceOf` to catch cases where we are looking for instances of a class\n- `typeof` to ensure we are checking against certain properties/types\n- properties of the types that we define\n\nIntersection types on the other hand, help us to create new instances of specific types\n\n```ts\nDate \u0026 {end:Date}\n```\n\n\n## Type Aliases\n\u003e A type alias is useful in helping to define a more meaningful name for a type and declare the different types using a specific alias\n\n```\ntype UserContactInfo = {\n\tname:string;\n\temail:string;\n}\n```\n\nWe can extend existing types by using the `intersection` operator\n\n```\ntype specialUserContact = userContactInfo \u0026 {getUserContact:() =\u003e string}\n```\n\n## Interfaces\nTypescript has both interfaces and classes. A class needs to `implement` an interface while an interface can only `extend` from existing interfaces\n\n```\ninterface AnimalLike {\n  eat(food:string): void\n}\n \nclass Dog implements AnimalLike {\n  bark() {\n    return \"woof\"\n  }\n  eat(food:string) {\n    return \n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n# Functions and Best Practices\n```ts\ntype addCalc = (x:number,y:number) =\u003e number\nconst add : addCalc = (a,b) =\u003e a+b\n```\n\nIf we have an function which returns an value we might want to ignore, we use a `void` value. If we are confident that it will not return any value at all, then we use the `undefined` keyword\n\n```\nfunction randomFunc():void{\n\t//doSomething\n}\n```","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.641028325Z","tags":null},"/notes/untitled":{"title":"Untitled","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.645028363Z","tags":null},"/notes/web3":{"title":"Web3","content":"\u003e These contain the notes that I made for the [Web3 Dao Course](https://www.learnweb3.io/)\n\n# Blockchain\n\n\u003e A blockchain is a shared, distributed, and permanent database shared among multiple nodes on a computer network. They record data in a way that makes it probabilistically impossible to modify or hack the system.\n\nBlockchains start off with a Genesis State when they launch. Bitcoin's genesis state happened in 2009 when the public network launched. Ethereum's Genesis State happened in 2015, when it launched.\n\nThe blockchain is then modified through [Blockchain Mining](notes/blockchain-mining.md) by miners which help to process these transactions in exchange for the native token of Etherium `Eth`.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [What Is A Blockchain ( Youtube )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)\n\n# Web3\n**tldr;**\n\nWeb1 :  Read\nWeb2 :  Read-Write\nWeb3 : Read-Write-Own\n\n## Web 1\nThe first phase of the Internet, Web1, was mainly about providing the everyday consumer with online content and information. As consumers could only read information or content online, and not yet interact with it, Web1 was incredibly static.\n\n## Web2\nWeb2 is the version of the internet most of us know and use today. Where Web1 was static and ‚Äúread-only,‚Äù Web2 is ‚Äúread-write,‚Äù and interactive. Under Web2, the internet became more usable: web2 was dynamic and users could consume, interact with, and create content on the internet themselves.\n\n## Web3\nWeb3, the future internet we‚Äôre moving towards, is a decentralized internet. Under Web3, the internet is shared online and governed by the collective ‚Äúwe,‚Äù rather than owned by centralized entities. The Web3 world is one that has open-source protocols at its foundation. Web3 is about rearchitecting internet services and products so that they benefit people rather than entities.\n\n\u003e Web3 enhances the web we know today by making it decentralized, distributed, open, trustless and permissionless.\n\n\n# Eth\n\u003e Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which only supports the transfer of the Bitcoin token around the network, Ethereum is more general purpose.\n\nWe can program [Smart Contracts](notes/smart-contracts.md) on Ethereum using [Solidity](notes/solidity.md) which is its native programming language. The network itself is mantained across a variety of different computer nodes which come together to form the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](notes/ethereum-virtual-machine.md). \n\nEtherium uses [Gas](notes/gas.md) in order to power the individual smart contracts.\n\n\n# Crypto Wallets\n\n**Definitions**\n-  **Address :**  An address is a string of text generated using cryptography to represent your account on the blockchain.\n- **Private Keys** : A private key is like a password that contains a bunch of letters and numbers that allow you to manage the crypto held by your address.\n- **Seed Phrase** : A seed phrase is a series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that give you access to the crypto associated with that wallet.\n- **Crypto Wallets** : Crypto wallets manage the private keys for your addresses\n\n# Tokens\n\n\u003e A¬†**_token_**¬†on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules ‚Äî namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share, such as¬†`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`¬†and¬†`balanceOf(address _owner)`.\n\nWe can learn more about [ERC Token Standards](notes/erc-token-standards.md) here.","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.669028592Z","tags":null},"/notes/what-im-reading":{"title":"What Im Reading","content":"\u003e Here's a quick collection of articles I liked and read recently.

He had what we call Satori 2 in Zen, an instant realization; his first flash of awakening. He understood and said to himself, ‚ÄòI have been too hard on myself. While in my father‚Äôs palace I lived a life of luxury, an almost debauched life, and now I have gone to the other extreme of depriving my body and mind of even basic nutrition and care\n- You are always tinkering your veena (lute),‚Äô one of the bards chastised his companion who was fixing the strings of his lute.‚ÄòEither you make the strings so tight they snap or you make them so loose that they are out of tune. Only if you leave them the way they are supposed to be, will you be able to produce melodious music\n- Living a graceful life that has meaning and happiness is an art anyone can master. Essentially, that is what Zen is about: a state free of conditioning so that the mind can rest and rejoice, so it may go with the flow of life without the anxiety to always get somewhere. Life is here. Now. Though it is easier said than done, it is possible\n- This is awakening in a nutshell: to have a graceful response to everything life throws at you without losing your sense of serenity and inner calm.\n- To be enlightened is to take things lightly (though not for granted), to laugh away the whims and irritabilities of life. We tend to take ourselves too seriously, making that the root cause of most of our agony\n- Even though I have used the word ‚Äògained‚Äô, enlightenment is not something you gain or attain, it is something you become.\n- You are sleeping and I am awake. You sleep through your whole lives, and I am aware of each passing moment.‚Äô\n- It should be noted that the philosophy of Zen says that if you meet Buddha on the road, kill him, because Zen believes that you must not idolize anybody. For when you idolize someone, you hinder your growth. Having said that, the tradition of the guru-disciple relationship is as alive in Zen as in any Eastern school of thought.\n- Maintaining awareness of the present moment requires doing one thing at a time so as to focus on your chief activity\n- Zen is breaking the automaticity of our actions and infusing them with mindfulness. Everything we do then becomes meditation, leading to greater peace\n- That is when your mind is perfectly, 100 per cent silent. Then you gain incredible insight into the nature of things, into the nature of your own life\n- When you get a hand on mindfulness and begin to put it to use in your daily life, I promise you that you will change forever (for the better). You will see things in life you were unable to see earlier\n- There is a very real and beautiful reason behind it. You see, a flower is a living thing. It has life and with time it withers.\n- When your mind blooms, the whole world is in spring. When it experiences autumn, no matter how much beauty there is in the external world, all feels lacklustre.\n- You are a flower and you have a beautiful life. Believe that. Compare your lifestyle to those of billions of people, who can‚Äôt even afford to live a basic life.\n- Not everybody enjoys the luxuries of life, but you do\n- Zen teaches us that happiness is not a pursuit. It‚Äôs not something we have to seek\n- In the thousand years after Buddha passed away, Zen did not really catch on. This is because people need anchors; people, they need rituals. When I say to people, ‚ÄòJust sit and be aware; you don‚Äôt have to do anything,‚Äô they think it isn‚Äôt sufficient\n- For 1000 years, people did not pay much attention to the Zen system of meditation partly because different sects had sprung out of the Buddhist thought and they were busy proving their supremacy over each other and busy fighting amongst themselves","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.617028097Z","tags":null},"/readwise/books/the-secret-history-of-the-mongol-queens":{"title":"The Secret History of the Mongol Queens","content":"# The Secret History of the Mongol Queens\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/default-book-icon-5.25188386e520.png)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [Weatherford, Jack](None)\n- Full Title: The Secret History of the Mongol Queens\n- Category: #books\n\n## Highlights\n- The Mongols, and certainly Genghis Khan in particular, placed great importance on sudden individual acts of unexpected heroism\n- He placed such importance on the spirit of the baatuud that he built his military and political system around them. The ideal government for him was rule by these heroic elites, by a true aristocracy of the spirit\n- Before the marriage, Botu ‚Äúcame as a son-in-law,‚Äù meaning that he came to live with the bride‚Äôs family as a form of service to them. According to steppe tradition, a potential groom or engaged boy resided with the family of his intended wife\n- he could not endure the hard work and discipline imposed by his potential father-and mother-in-law, he might run away. If they developed a working relationship, the marriage between the engaged youths would evolve and blossom in its own natural time\n- With this early negotiation, the young Temujin articulated a firm principle, which he followed throughout his life when dealing with the women of his family: Women could never be traded for animals or property. Once he came to power, he made this personal affirmation into law.\n- By asking for a set of marriages, Genghis Khan knew that this would be seen as making Mongols equal to Kereyid and himself equal to Ong Khan‚Äôs other son.\n- Terge Emel‚Äôs contempt for Genghis Khan indicates how low the Mongols ranked in the hierarchy of steppe tribes\n- For Genghis Khan, negotiating the dualism of existence, finding the correct balance, became a lifetime quest\n- The management of the man‚Äôs fortune,‚Äù according to Persian reports, ‚Äúbelongs to the women: They buy and sell as they think fit.‚Äù\n- Mongol men were considered sexually shy at marriage, and part of a wife‚Äôs duty was to coax her husband into his role.\n- Instead of herding the father-in-law‚Äôs goats, camels, and yaks, these sons-in-law became herders of men; they would serve in Genghis Khan‚Äôs army and fight in his wars. Genghis Khan often sent his guregen on the most dangerous missions, however, and they tended to be killed at a high rate. Most of them never had the chance to return home for very long. Being a son-in-law to Genghis Khan was not merely an apprenticeship phase, as it would be for a small herder; for these men it became a brief, but usually lethal, career.\n- He served virtually as the sacrificial victim in exchange for his tribe‚Äôs prosperity. He would give his life in battle for Genghis Khan, and in return his tribe would benefit and his own offspring would be rewarded. A guregen entered into a harsh bargain.\n- Borte conceived her first child close to the time of her kidnapping, Genghis Khan insisted that, aside from the mother, it was no one‚Äôs business how she became pregnant.\n- When Genghis Khan‚Äôs wife\n- His laws regarding women did not spring from an ideological position or special spiritual revelation so much as from personal experience and the practical needs of running a harmonious society\n- wives were too old to take command of these new nations and to enjoy the full benefits of what he had to offer, but he had a new generation of women who seemed as capable as the previous one\n- Genghis Khan‚Äôs mother and\n- only place that the Silk Route is actually a single route is the easternmost area of the roughly one thousand miles from Dunhuang into the heartland of China via Xian.\n- As Borte‚Äôs father explained: the Khongirad did not depend on the strength of their sons; they trusted instead in the beauty and cleverness of their daughters to protect them. He said that their daughters rode on carts pulled by black camels, and that they married powerful men and became queens to negotiate, intercede, and protect them. ‚ÄúFrom ancient time,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe Khongirad people have queens as our shields.\n- Two of Alaqai‚Äôs sisters rapidly followed as queens over two other Turkic groups: the Uighurs in what is now the Xinjiang region of western China and the Karluk to the northwest in what is now Kazakhstan\n- He told her that, as a Mongol queen, he gave her three husbands. Her nation was her first husband. Her second husband was her own reputation. In third place came the earthly man to whom she was married. Of the three, he wanted it clear that her priority was to her duty and her nation.\n- Wine made from grapes developed a higher alcohol level than the fermented beverages to which the Mongols were accustomed. Grapes had to be harvested at the appropriate time, but once they were made into wine, the alcohol could be stored for years and thus consumed without regard to season","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.617028097Z","tags":null},"/readwise/podcasts/10.-les-mots-franais-qui-viennent-de-langlais":{"title":"10.

I'm open to rethinking it, but I also I need to take action and I need to do something and then you have an escalation of commitment, the more action you take, which it becomes harder and harder to rethink the sunk costs building up. You have other sort of escalations. How do you balance those two things between being open and also affording yourself the choices that you need to make to exist in an organization and seize opportunity? \n  Speaker 0: I don't know that there's a way to get the best of both worlds in every situation. I do think though, that you can create conditions that at least increase the probability that you end up both open and decisive at the same time, which is a sort of strange combination. So for ([Time¬†0:13:51](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2ed))\n    - Note: Goal is to be open and decisive - setting co dictions yo rethink\n- Speaker 0: ultimately will require a bigger investment of time. It probably requires more people involved too. Uh That time has an opportunity cost. And so maybe we feel like we're giving something up, I don't know about you. If I'm going to hire someone and commit to working with them, I cannot invest enough time up front to decide that that's a good choice. It's interesting to \n  Speaker 1: me to listen to you say that because what comes to mind is like, there are organizations that invest incredible amounts of energy, time money into this, their sports organization, all sports before they draft somebody. It's like, what is the person's character? How well do they recognize the place? How well do they, is it intuition versus professionalism on their part? Right. And they have these ways of evaluating ([Time¬†0:19:53](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2d8))\n    - Note: Example of interview process which is more algorithmic\n- Speaker 0: your ways of fixing those flaws. And I think ironically knowing that people might be a little bit on guard or a little bit suspicious actually lead leaders to be more authentic and to come in and say, you know what the whole reason that I'm going to talk about areas for growth is. I want to get better. And so the more honest I can be about that, the more likely I am to grow. And so I think it's the responsibility of people in power to open that door and keep it open right and this this step to prove right here is the stuff people told me I am terrible at, here's how I've benefited from hearing those things in the past. That's one of the best ways that you can show that you really mean it. I think when \n  Speaker 1: I asked this question about psychological safety, I actually presume to know what some of those ([Time¬†0:27:19](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea31a4f0c000e83ac10))\n    - Note: Leadership and psychological safety\n- Speaker 0: mistakes I made, when I talk about embarrassing decisions I've made. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to signal to our kids that it's okay to be wrong and it's okay to rethink the choices we've made. Uh that's to me, one of the functions of regret, right? I I think of most negative emotions as teachable moments and the whole point of experiencing them is you're supposed to learn something from what you did wrong so you can make it right in the future. And so much of regret is saying, okay, I did something that uh that lead to an undesirable outcome or that violated one of my values. And so how do I do this differently? Moving forward Instead of trying to deny these emotions? Let's actually listen to them and figure out what the lesson is in them. \n  Speaker 1: You mentioned rewriting the history ([Time¬†0:52:47](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6dea3a4042f000f4df2f3))\n    - Note: Parenting rewriting\n- Speaker 0: not just experiments, Those are those are real commitments. And I think this is as relevant to personal decisions as it is to running a company right to say, okay, before I go into a major decision, if it is both irreversible and highly consequential, then I want to spend a lot of time rethinking my own views up front. Whereas if it's pretty easy to reverse an undue or it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go forward and make the decision knowing I'll have time later and the opportunity later to second guess it. \n  Speaker 1: But it's not enough to just sort of convince yourself you have the opportunity, you have to be of the mindset that that's sort of almost what you're looking to do. Did you learn anything else from Jeff and or amazon about how they make decisions?

If I can emphasize anything today, it's that what you eat \n  Speaker 0: and when you eat \n  Speaker 1: it set conditions in your body \n  Speaker 0: and those conditions can be very good for you or very \n  Speaker 1: bad for you depending on when you eat. \n  Speaker 0: In fact when you eat is as important as what you ([Time¬†0:19:56](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b33a))\n    - Note: When you eat is as important to why you eat\n- Speaker 0: So insulin and glucose go up when we eat and it takes some period of time for them to go down. Even if we stop \n  Speaker 1: eating, they will remain up for some period of time and then go back down. It takes time. \n  Speaker 0: This is very important because if you look at the scientific literature \n  Speaker 1: on fasting \n  Speaker 0: on time restricted feeding, it's absolutely clear \n  Speaker 1: that the health benefits not just the weight loss benefits, but that the health benefits from time restricted feeding \n  Speaker 0: occur because certain conditions are met in the brain and body for a certain amount of time and that gives us an anchor for from which to view what eating is in terms of how it sets conditions \n  Speaker 1: in the body over ([Time¬†0:23:34](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4106b6164086c09b317))\n    - Note: The most important thing is to set the conditions that are best for brain or your body\n- Speaker 0: of one's day. So for humans that's typically in the \n  Speaker 1: early part of the day \n  Speaker 0: or the later \n  Speaker 1: part of the day, but not at night. \n  Speaker 0: Put very simply. There are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24 hour cycle is very \n  Speaker 1: detrimental to one's health. In fact, \n  Speaker 0: when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health when we see light, can enhance our feelings of well being or can diminish \n  Speaker 1: our feelings of wellbeing. \n  Speaker 0: I've talked many times before about this on \n  Speaker 1: the Huberman lab podcast that \n  Speaker 0: during the daytime you want to get as much sunlight and other types of \n  Speaker 1: bright light in your eyes as is safely possible. And \n  Speaker 0: then you want to avoid light in the middle of the ([Time¬†0:31:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4116b6164086c09b388))\n    - Note: Get as much light as possible in the morning\n- Speaker 0: when you eat is as important as what you eat In this study, they saw something really interesting which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit. \n  Speaker 1: things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that I'll talk about in a moment, \n  Speaker 0: but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular, stable so called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm. You may be surprised to learn that 80% 80% of the genes in your \n  Speaker 1: body and brain \n  Speaker 0: are on a 24 hour schedule. That is, they change their \n  Speaker 1: Levels going from high to low ([Time¬†0:32:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/625ad4116b6164086c09b3b4))\n    - Note: Fasting with an allows for the expression of epigenetic genes at the right time","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.621028135Z","tags":null},"/readwise/podcasts/gary-shilling-what-is-the-consensus-view-getting-wrong":{"title":"Gary Shilling What Is the Consensus View Getting Wrong","content":"# Gary Shilling: What Is the Consensus View Getting Wrong?\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://megaphone.imgix.net/podcasts/5e9346f8-9133-11ea-af6f-07ab45ebc34b/image/_RV-PCST-1400x1400.png?ixlib=rails-2.1.2\u0026max-w=3000\u0026max-h=3000\u0026fit=crop\u0026auto=format,compress)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [Real Vision Daily Briefing: Finance \u0026 Investing](None)\n- Full Title: Gary Shilling: What Is the Consensus View Getting Wrong?\n- Category: #podcasts\n- URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/60d8b601f2ae79000e4c2df0\n\n## Highlights\n- AirrQuote ([Time¬†0:01:16](https://www.airr.io/quote/60d9ebc2339f8e000ffcd543))","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.617028097Z","tags":null},"/readwise/podcasts/this-is-the-vision-for-defi-built-on-bitcoin":{"title":"This Is the Vision for DeFi Built on Bitcoin","content":"# This Is the Vision for DeFi Built on Bitcoin\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/e73c998e-6e60-432f-8610-ae210140c5b1/8a94442e-5a74-4fa2-8b8d-ae27003a8d6b/982f5071-765c-403d-969d-ae27003a8d83/image.jpg?t=1642995193\u0026size=Large)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [Odd Lots](None)\n- Full Title: This Is the Vision for DeFi Built on Bitcoin\n- Category: #podcasts\n- URL: https://www.airr.io/episode/60dd7c738299c1000e711893\n\n## Highlights\n- Speaker 0: in this market cycle is that it creates efficiencies that are relevant for smart contracting, both at the base layer and at higher layers in payment channels, for instance, like lightning network. So that's exciting. Taproot is will activate in november and not only will it have an impact on privacy scalability of the core protocol, but it will also impact, like I said, opportunities in smart contracting and it will allow us it'll sort of set the stage for future upgrades like any prev out which has relevancy for other sorts of increased functionality at the lightning network level. And that's quite important because when we're thinking about ([Time¬†0:06:11](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478662))\n    - Note: Taproot is coming to Bitcoin\n- Speaker 0: data center, software, cybersecurity, foundational sort of technologies and Bitcoin. I found Bitcoin in that sort of mind space. And so I saw Bitcoin first as a protocol as a technology that would be a platform for the proliferation of a new sort of app ecosystem. And you know, in that way I approach it really as a sound tech maximum, not as a Bitcoin maximalist per se. I also spent time in 2013 2014 looking at all coins. I I think that I was the second or third maybe VC two due diligence in the I C. O space even ([Time¬†0:09:03](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478667))\n    - Note: Her stance on bi coin\n- Speaker 0: Okay, so a couple things you said a couple of things there, I'll try to hit all of them. So you talked a little bit about the attention shifting to defy this space where 100,000 traders have permission list access to trade sort of the long tail of assets that they might not otherwise have access to and they can do that without having to go through a K Y C process. And you know, it's also interesting to see folks making money in a quick way and it attracts media attention now. On the Bitcoin side. What's been happening is that Bitcoin has been declared a legal tender in El Salvador, we've seen the folks in El Salvador used Bitcoin on a day to day basis by using the Lightning ([Time¬†0:16:29](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b6001147866d))\n    - Note: Big question about Bitcoin maximimalism\n- Speaker 0: see folks like thinks that taking advantage of that now to talk about some of the development in the side chain space, we maybe, I'll start with stacks, which is a side channel air one side chain, they define it as in the Bitcoin space that has fully functional smart contracts live as of january of this year. We're seeing contracts of up to a billion dollars in aggregate commitments be present in that environment. Recently it was announced that there is an accelerator built to fund companies that are that are building in the stacks ecosystem. You know, I think that my expectation is that we will see projects like a, you know, swap like ([Time¬†0:23:32](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba662))\n    - Note: Interesting developments in Bitcoin including Sphinx\n- Speaker 0: or in lieu of it being present on Bitcoin and liquid does that. So as an example, liquid has smart contracting capability through something called covenants, which just means that you can essentially programmed Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is programmable money, It is that at the base layer, that's, you know, one of the areas of popular fud that I've seen from this bull market is, you know, saying that Bitcoin doesn't allow for smart contracts. And of course, that's not true. Bitcoin. Smart contracting has always existed at the core protocol level, but the sort of smart contracts that you can do on liquid as well as of the side chains take it a step further in. Bitcoin has that with covenants ([Time¬†0:24:46](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db53e103b60011478675))\n    - Note: Side chains in Bitcoin\n- Speaker 1: something resembling UNICEF or care about having N. F. T. S on the side change versus how much is it? Is it just to prove that it can theoretically be done \n  Speaker 0: well? Bitcoin owners are not a monolith, right? And so it doesn't, I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure frankly that I care what Bitcoin or that we should care about what Bitcoin Ear's which I imagine you're mostly referring to folks that are active on social media. I'm not sure that it matters what folks want. The importance of Bitcoin owners to Bitcoin is that they are, it's a stakeholder group in a multi stakeholder ecosystem. So you have folks that use the tech and that's ([Time¬†0:27:26](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e2db535a28d2000f2ba65d))\n    - Note: Do Bitcoinera even care about side chains\n- Speaker 1: So I want to actually ask you a uh about a controversy in the question of Bitcoin development and there is a view that you're on the board of blog stream. There's all these criticisms, even among Bitcoin is a blog stream that it exerts an extraordinary amount of influence on Bitcoin core development that there are all there are other ideas such as drive chains, which is a different idea for scaling ([Time¬†0:35:22](https://www.airr.io/quote/60e6d2f0a4042f000f4d8603))\n    - Note: Hard Forks ba Soft forks","lastmodified":"2022-07-24T14:28:55.617028097Z","tags":null},"/readwise/tweets/tweets-from-trung-phan":{"title":"Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶","content":"# Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶\n\n![rw-book-cover](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1506362585448296448/LJg8kVSD.jpg)\n\n## Metadata\n- Author: [@TrungTPhan on Twitter](None)\n- Full Title: Tweets From Trung Phan üá®üá¶\n- Category: #tweets\n- URL: https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan\n\n## Highlights\n- 21/ We did it folks.
