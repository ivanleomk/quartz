If you don‚Äôt believe me, think how annoyed you get when the WiFi doesn‚Äôt work, then consider that humanity existed quite happily without it for hundreds of thousands of years.\n* The second, called ‚Äòimmune neglect‚Äô, is that we are often unaware that we‚Äôll adapt to the good or bad things that happen.\n* For instance, we tend not to remember the whole of an experience (‚Äòduration neglect‚Äô) but instead remember the peaks and ends of our experiences\n* Curiously enough, there‚Äôs good evidence that being happy has other positive effects: happy people are more likely to get married, get promoted, earn more, have more friends, be healthier, live longer, etc.\n* I‚Äôve already said that we adapt to external factors like success. If you give up happiness now in the hope of getting it later, and you don‚Äôt get it later, then you‚Äôve lost out twice,","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:15:47.170810319Z","tags":null},"/highlights/notes-on-work":{"title":"Notes on Work","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/notes-on-work](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/notes-on-work)\n* Published Date: 2022-02-01\n* Author: [Weike Wang](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* I appreciate what Andrew Carnegie suggested: a person should spend the first third of his life getting as much education as he can, the next third making as much money as he can, and then the last third giving it all away.","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:15:47.170810319Z","tags":null},"/highlights/the-career-success-guide":{"title":"The Career Success Guide","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-career-success-guide](https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-career-success-guide)\n* Published Date: 2022-03-30\n* Author: [Sahil Bloom](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* But \"mentorship\" feels very formal. It carries a connotation of a fixed cadence and time commitment. From the mentor's perspective, it feels like a big commitment. Furthermore, having one formal mentor often falls short\n* When you screw up, own it. Then build a system so it never happens again.\n* Companies have boards‚Äîideally comprised of individuals from varying backgrounds and arenas. The board isn't involved in the day-to-day, but provides advice on strategy, key decisions, and challenges. Your Personal Board of Advisors is a group of 5-10 individuals. Important features: * Unbiased (not family) * Diverse experiences and backgrounds * Willing to provide raw feedback Over time, you can add and subtract from your board. The members don't need to know each other or that they are on your board. Informality is a feature, not a bug.","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:15:47.170810319Z","tags":null},"/highlights/two-vexing-problems-in-functional-programming":{"title":"Two vexing problems in functional programming","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/two-vexing-problems-in-functional-progamming.html](https://matthewbutterick.com/chron/two-vexing-problems-in-functional-progamming.html)\n\n## Highlights\n* Compared to imperative programming, functional programming is arguably a worse representation of low-level computing (meaning, the part that contends with the mechan¬≠ical characteristics of the computer), but a better repre¬≠sen¬≠ta¬≠tion of high-level computing (meaning, the part that models ideas through data struc¬≠tures and algo¬≠rithms).\n* discipline.

Moving served the vast pasture needs of their herds of sheep, goats, yaks, and horses. Though seemingly an endless grassland, the steppe was relatively arid.\n* The challenges of that scenario mostly had to do with the calories in a steppe warrior‚Äôs ration and the acres of grass required for a large herd of horses.\n* The documentary record for the Mongols on campaign varies, suggesting that each warrior brought along as few as two and as many as 18 horses. That‚Äôs an enormous variation, but most historians have settled on five or six, mostly mares, with some geldings. In addition, at least during the Mongol imperial campaigns, there is solid evidence for sheep being brought along with the army, even on its more rapid movements.","lastmodified":"2022-04-05T02:15:47.170810319Z","tags":null},"/highlights/why-i-got-a-phd-at-age-61":{"title":"Why I got a PhD at age 61","content":"## Metadata\n* URL: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00949-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00949-z)\n* Author: [Zolt√°n K√≥csi](None)\n\n## Highlights\n* New knowledge enriches you, regardless of how old you are.
