> How to be a writer

Start writing and worry every single day if you've penned a phrase the right way. Spend hours, maybe even days worrying about the perspective you've chosen - is it the best to use a second, first, third or maybe even a seventh? 

Fall in love for a brief moment with the idea of being published and then retreat inwards with fear after realising that would mean countless individuals would read your work. Spend time thinking about what this would mean for you as a writer and agnoize further again about whether it's what you want to do.

But then realise that you can bring characters to life which were preivously only in your head, think about the fun you can have creating crazy worlds which will never exist anywhere else in space or time but your imagination and go wild with the things you want to create.

Start fleshing out countless random lore about the worlds you do decide to invest some time in and realise that concocting a religion from scratch is not the easiest thing to do. Move on to try and spin up some random cultural terms from the back of your head before realising that you've pulled it from that discovery channel show you watched 3 months ago.

Agonize a little bit over potential copyright infringement and then continue on your merry way.
