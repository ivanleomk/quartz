## Highlights
* Bond yields remain at their highest levels in 3 years as shorter maturities have been selling off faster than longer-dated ones, reflecting investorsâ€™ expectations that the Fed will hike rates more aggressively to combat inflation.
* The US gas is exporting more liquid natural gas (LNG) than ever in an effort to replace Russian supplies in Europe, and last week President Biden promised to more than double the volume of those shipments in the coming years.
