## Highlights
* “You cannot remove struggle from life, but you can improve your ability to handle challenge.”
* “Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then, do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.”
