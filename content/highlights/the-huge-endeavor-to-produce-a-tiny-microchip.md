## Highlights
* Chip makers are packing more and more transistors onto each piece of silicon, which is why technology does more each year. It’s also the reason that new chip factories cost billions and fewer companies can afford to build them.
* Fabs are water-intensive operations. That’s because water is needed to clean wafers at many stages of the production process.
