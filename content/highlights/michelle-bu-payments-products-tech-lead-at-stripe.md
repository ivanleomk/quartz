## Highlights
* I typically spend 80% of my time on one or two large cross-organizational design projects. I spend the remaining 20% reviewing and supporting technical and product design (in particular, API design) across the organization.
* Broad-scoped engineers create impact by working on vague, cross-organizational projects. They tend to accumulate a lot of context across many different domains and play a support role in many projects across the org. This shape of Staff-plus Engineer is most common on our product engineering teams.
* Deep-scoped engineers tend to be subject-matter experts in a specific domain. They lead ambitious multi-year projects.
* I measure my impact based on their progress and more importantly, the directionality of that progress and the alignment of their work to the company’s goals.
* To maintain context in my new role, I spend a good amount of time in one-on-ones with engineers and PMs working directly on execution.
* (We have a Slack group you can join to be automatically invited to Slack rooms for each incident!)
  * **Note**: This is an interesting thing to have as a general status quo
* At this point I spend less time advocating for specific technologies or programs and more time empowering others to advocate for the technologies and programs that they think are important.
* I spend a lot of time having direct conversations with the engineers and PMs who are actually making day-to-day decisions. The ideal outcome is that we’re able to get directionally aligned, and they’re then able to advocate for our north star within their teams and make good local decisions.
* If two people asked the same question, we immediately added it to a FAQ that we kept.
  * **Note**: Good suggestion
* I strongly believe that as long as I'm being thoughtful about my technical gaps, about filling in those gaps for the projects I'm working on, and about challenging myself with projects that take me outside of my technical comfort zone, I can build up and practice my technical skills organically. The softer skills, the connections across the company, the user focus, understanding the product deeply—these are the skills that took much longer to learn and ultimately helped me accelerate my path to Staff after I built my technical foundation.
* I think that’s an important criteria for Staff-plus Engineers in product: not to just build something that ships, but for it to roll out smoothly and continue to succeed and grow over time with as few regrettable choices as possible.
* To be honest, at the time I didn’t really understand how to write my self-reviews the right way. I wrote self-reflective development plans for what I wanted to learn over the next year instead of documenting the impact and scope of my work. My manager actually did most of the work by writing out my impact in his review.
* That said, my first piece of advice to engineers is that they should avoid pattern matching in ways that lead them towards work they don’t enjoy.
* Staff-plus. A big component of being successful as a Staff-plus Engineer is being able to identify and scope net-new impactful work and to convince others of its value and impact.
