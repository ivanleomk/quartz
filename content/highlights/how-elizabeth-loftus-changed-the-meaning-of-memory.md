## Highlights
* Loftus’s career has been defined by her recognition that the language we use to describe an event will change the way we remember it.
* Defense lawyers began calling on her to testify about the ways that memories are distorted by leading questions, sloppy police lineups, and
* Loftus, said that she “obliterated the idea that there is a permanent, stable memory capacity in humans.” He told me, “Her work changed the whole story of what an eyewitness case was about, and destabilized a solid and routine part of the criminal caseload.”
* She could find little experimental evidence to support the idea that memories of trauma, after remaining dormant for a decade or more, could abruptly spring to life, and she worried that therapists, through hypnosis and other suggestive techniques, were coaxing memories into being.
* Few psychologists have been more influential than Loftus in revealing how standard police procedures can contaminate memory.
* I asked if it was similar to what Susan Brison, a philosopher who has written about her experience of rape, had characterized in her book, “Aftermath,” as a process of taking control of one’s narrative.
