## Highlights
* On a wider scale, I am concerned about most mainstream blockchains’ scalability and ease of use to accommodate the eventual large asset values that it will need to secure should we see mass adoption by traditional finance.
* our progressive DeFi technology is catching up with demand, while the existing infrastructure of retail TradFi trading is simply behind the times – it has held its users hostage with purposefully limited accessibility and lagging software integration since the beginning of the internet,
  * **Note**: This is a common narrative and it’ll be interesting to see how things play out here
* sharding allows a network to be split up into shards – nodes validating the network that can then oversee a small portion of the network (instead of the whole thing) with drastically reduced compute power, and this allows for a higher throughput across the whole blockchain.
* Well, not really; the current issue with Ethereum’s sharding solution is that there is no cross-shard consensus… Strap in here we go down the consensus rabbit hole.
* Consensus is the mechanism whereby nodes that operate and validate the network agree upon a transaction, or series of transactions, which are then added to the blockchain or distributed ledger. Both
* If these nodes act in bad faith or are down for an extended period of time then slashing can occur, meaning a portion of the staked amount of each token is slashed from the node.
* Tokens can in fact act like real physical/digital assets: they become a Component that is sent from one user to another (or more accurately the ownership of a particular component changes hands within transactions).
