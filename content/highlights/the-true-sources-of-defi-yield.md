## Highlights
* The example serves to illustrate that to understand a protocol’s yield, you must understand the assets by which the yield is being disbursed.
* The annual percentage rate is the amount of additional value you accrue per year. The annual percentage yield is the amount of additional value you accrue per year assuming compounding (i.e. reinvestment of dividends).
* Thus, projected APY may or may not resemble actual APY depending on past and future market conditions. Mitigate this risk by understanding the time horizon on which protocol APY figures are computed.
* Clearly, this type of service has intrinsic value: the ability to automatically cover, originate, liquidate, and close loans without a financial intermediary is valuable in and of itself: it eliminates the possibility of human error, allows greater capital efficiency, and so on.
* Many protocols use the term “staking” to refer to any locking-up-of-assets, but this is not correct. Staking, in its true sense, is to risk loss of value for potential gain of value.
* By locking up your assets with a validator, you are earning yield by contributing to the security of the underlying network, which is intrinsically valuable, and you are risking the possibility of losses if the validator is dishonest or broken.
