## Highlights
* In data-centric apps, much of the complexity of building and modifying the app comes from managing and propagating state.
* A reactive system tracks dependencies between data and automatically keeps downstream data updated, so that the developer doesnâ€™t need to manually propagate change.
* We hypothesize this is because developers are used to interacting with databases over the network, where network latencies apply.
