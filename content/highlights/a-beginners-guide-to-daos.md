## Highlights
* A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group organized around a mission that coordinates through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain.
* all actions and funding in the DAO are viewable by anyone.
* Given the transparency and lower barriers to entry, there will likely be lower switching costs for DAO members who don’t agree with the rules and actions.
* Perhaps the most notorious DAO so far was The DAO which launched in April 2016 as a decentralized venture capital fund.
* Crypto projects themselves can be considered DAOs if they are managed by decentralized governance where token holders can vote on the direction of the project or various parameter settings, rather than solely determined by a centralized team.
* Unlike traditional companies where profits are paid out pro rata, this DAO is setup such that voting power and revenue share is weighted according to the length of time a token holder has remained invested.
* think the creation of these types of borrowing and lending systems will be inevitable and will only lead projects to harden their governance system.
* With DAOs, we’ll be able to experiment with governance systems at a rapid pace to quickly improve on what works and what doesn’t.
* DAOs are powerful ways to organize but there may be potential issues with them and they aren’t the ideal system for everything.
