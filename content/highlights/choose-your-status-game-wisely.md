## Highlights
* My story illustrates how different communities value different things when it comes to conferring status.
* Because whatever status game you choose in life ultimately determines what you optimize for. Choose money and you’ll end up working all the time. Choose beauty and you’ll always want to look better.
* Though the pursuit of status is a hard temptation to fight off, there is a simple way to prevent it from controlling you—play multiple status games at once.
* There is no rule that states that you have to judge yourself by a singular dimension, even if society suggests otherwise.
