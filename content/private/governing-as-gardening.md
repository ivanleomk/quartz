title: "Governing as Gardening"
---

- Soft Authoritarianism is a state whereby there are minimal components of democracy within the system but as a conseuqence of rapid modernisation, state control of the economy and an emphasis on export-driven growth, basic social and political rights are compromised
	- The rule of law is replaced with the rule of virtue in which the duties of the citizen to the state are more important than the responsibilities of the state towards the citizen
	- The state constructs an educational system to discipline the electorate rather than to create an informed citizenry => Direct result of low trust between leaders and electorate
	- Citizen's role is merely to consent to the legitimacy of the regime and the state's role is to provide security by weeding out citizens who are troublesome.
	- Soft Authoriatarianism that invest heavily in human capital eventually fails because in the long run, an educated eletorate will want, as active and informed citizens, to participate effectively in politics. 
		- They are self-limiting because 
			- eventually the founding generation dies off
			- Electorate changes to a more demogratic regime after rising educational standards
			- Educated middle classese become more disillusioned with the government
- Humanistic education and physical development of citizens are major tasks of society. But authoritarian societies are  based on a distrust of citizens and thus the population is constantly warned of the dangers of dissent, subversion and open opposition. 
	- There is a strong tendency towards one-party rule in which opposition parties are characterized as both incompetent and disloyal.
- Singapore Govenrment has a neo-confucian view
	- **With Careful Oversight, citizens can be cultivated until they become rational and law abiding**
		- Overriding rhetoric is that in the absence of natural assets, Singapore has to rely on the creation of talent in its own population to survive.
		- Citizenship education was concieved in terms of conveying ethics, especially that of Asian values of family, fillial duties and loyalty.
		- National Education launched as a nation-building exercise in order to produce a more critical form ofknowledge about Singapore.
			- Young Singaporeans encouraged to have a sense of wonership of their own society
	- Singapore's goal is to be an Asian meritocracy rather than a western-style democracy while simultaneously also looking to weed out people who did not fit the Singaporean model of an obedient citizen.
		- Upgrade Islam to become modern and rational
		- Root out dissent from middle class catholics
		- Political metaphor of gardening through which the state seeks to civilise its population by weeding out those who do not fit and cultivating those who can be trusted to keep the existing government in power.
	- The goal is to create the idael citizen which is passive and whose sole duty is to recognise the legitimacy of the regime
		- Singapore survives because it has created a politicallt apathetic citizenry
		- the PAP rules through harsh legislation and frequent use of defamation suits, parliamant is under the control of the state bureacracy
		- Economy has been more or less consistently succesful, thereby delivering considerable benefits to a compliant population
		- As a result, we create a highly regulated civil society
	- More than three-quarters of the Singaporean population live in apartments on 99-year leases from the government
		- This allows the government to organise the racial composition of the electrorate but also mete out discrimination in the dispensing of state infrastructure against electorates that vote against opposition parties
- Three Main Points
	- Political Gardenning was the basic value on which the Singapore Government functioned
		- There are undeniable authoritarian aspects of the Singapore govenrment which include the use of 'draconian laws, control on political participation and measures limiting civil and political rights and freedom of the press
		- Singapore's predominant chinese population also meant that it was effectively a confucian society which was able to produce a remarkable degree of social conformism
		- Singapore is a soft authoritarianism model
			- It is communitarain in nature, emphasizing conformity to group interests over individual rights. In singapore, this manifests itself in the form of confucian values that champion order, a strong but moral state and the needs of society as a whole over person lfreedoms and limitations on government
			- It integrates a market-driven economic model with a kind of paternalistic authoritarinism that persuades rather than coerces.
		- Within Singapore itself, the political elite attempt to control major dimensions of society such as housing, population, migration and the economy. The making of today's society has involved the elimination of all forms of civil society.
	- Political Weeding was undertaken using the regular use of the law to control individuals or groups that showed a serious propensity to criticize the government
		- The Lee family has been succesful not in the arbitrary use of force but in rational legal measures such as turning to the courts to crush any criticism of their family or the government through the libel laws.
