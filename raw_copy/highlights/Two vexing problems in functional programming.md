## Highlights
* Compared to imperative programming, functional programming is arguably a worse representation of low-level computing (meaning, the part that contends with the mechan­ical characteristics of the computer), but a better repre­sen­ta­tion of high-level computing (meaning, the part that models ideas through data struc­tures and algo­rithms).
* discipline. By making func­tions entirely self-contained as to input and output, it becomes easier to reason about the behavior of each indi­vidual func­tion.
* Func­tional program­ming, however, suggests we should create and destroy these struc­tures willy-nilly. But memory oper­a­tions are never free. There­fore, this prin­ciple of func­tional program­ming will always become imprac­ti­cally wasteful for suffi­ciently large memory struc­tures. For
