## Highlights
* by enriching the state of types with the possible runtime state, flow typing makes software more expressive and its development safer.
* TypeScript and Python's type hints were built for languages where the runtime shapes of values can vary arbitrarily.
* Another downside of flow typing is that languages which generate memory layouts from types must perform implicit casts when types are narrowed.
